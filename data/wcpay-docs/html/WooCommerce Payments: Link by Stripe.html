<ol start="5">
<li>You’re done! Link by Stripe should start working automatically.</li>
</ol>



<div class="wp-block-coblocks-alert" aria-label="Alert section"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-alert__title"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Link by Stripe and <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woopay-merchant-documentation/">WooPay</a> are currently incompatible.

<p>When a customer goes through the checkout on your site for the first time after you enable Link by Stripe, they will see the following field asking for their phone number:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.10.22-UTC@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18734000416187" width="437" height="595" srcset="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.10.22-UTC@2x.png 742w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.10.22-UTC@2x.png?resize=620,844 620w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.10.22-UTC@2x.png?resize=650,885 650w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.10.22-UTC@2x.png?resize=300,408 300w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px"></figure></div>


<p>Whether or not they choose to enter their phone number and save their information into Link by Stripe, the rest of the checkout process will work as normal.</p>



<p>If they do enter their phone and elect to save their information, Stripe will create a Link account for them using the email address they entered in the checkout form. These accounts can be managed via <a href="https://link.co/">the Link by Stripe website</a>.</p>

<p>If a customer already has a Link by Stripe account, whether it was created on your site or any other site that uses Link by Stripe, the checkout process will become much faster.</p>



<p>As soon as they enter their email address on your checkout page, they will see this prompt, asking them to verify their phone number:</p>

<p>Link by Stripe will automatically send a message to their phone number, and when the customer enters that into the Link by Stripe popup, they will be asked to double-check their payment method and shipping address like so:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.17.41-UTC@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18734000416219" width="463" height="416" srcset="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.17.41-UTC@2x.png 1146w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.17.41-UTC@2x.png?resize=620,558 620w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.17.41-UTC@2x.png?resize=768,692 768w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.17.41-UTC@2x.png?resize=650,585 650w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.17.41-UTC@2x.png?resize=300,270 300w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.17.41-UTC@2x.png?resize=958,863 958w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px"></figure></div>


<p>After the customer has selected their payment method and address, and then clicked <strong>Autofill Checkout</strong>, their information will be automatically put into the appropriate checkout fields. From there, the checkout process continues as normal.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="logged-in-user-experience"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#logged-in-user-experience">Logged in user experience<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>If a customer has an account on your site and also has an existing Link by Stripe account, they will see this Link logo in the email field of your checkout page:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18734000416238" width="647" height="302" srcset="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png 1678w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png?resize=620,290 620w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png?resize=768,359 768w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png?resize=650,304 650w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png?resize=1536,718 1536w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png?resize=300,140 300w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-05-06-at-19.26.52-UTC@2x.png?resize=958,448 958w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px"></figure>



<p>By clicking that logo, the Link by Stripe phone verification popup will trigger, just like in the <em>Enrolled Link by Stripe User Experience</em> section above. From there, the checkout process works exactly the same as described in that section.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="testing"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#testing">Testing<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>You can test Link by Stripe just like other payment methods to see how it functions without actually performing a real transaction. To do so, you must first have WooCommerce Payments in <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/testing-and-troubleshooting/testing/">test mode</a>, enable the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/additional-payment-methods/">new checkout experience</a>, and <a href="#enabling-link-by-stripe">enable Link by Stripe</a> itself.</p>



<p>Once those requirements are in place, you can test Link by Stripe like so:</p>



<ol>
<li>Log out of your site and any Link by Stripe accounts.</li>



<li>Open your site, add a product to the cart, and go to checkout.</li>



<li>For the email address, enter one you have not used on the site before.</li>



<li>Fill out the rest of the checkout form with fake data.
<ul>
<li>Do not use real personal information in test mode!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Enter the test card info in the payment form.</li>



<li>Check the “Save your info for secure 1-click checkout with Link” box.</li>



<li>Enter <code>201-555-0123</code> as the phone number.</li>



<li>Place the order.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you log back into the site as an administrator, you should now be able to see the order under <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Orders</strong> just like normal.</p>



<p>To test how an <em>existing</em> Link by Stripe user makes a purchase:</p>



<ol>
<li>Log back out of your site.</li>



<li>Open your shop, add a product to the cart, and go to checkout.</li>



<li>For the email address, enter the same one you used above</li>



<li>The popup will appear to ask for a six digit code. Enter <code>000 000</code>.</li>



<li>When the popup shows the fake information you entered before, click <strong>Autofill checkout</strong>.</li>



<li>Your information will be filled, and you can place the order.</li>
</ol>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="managing-accounts"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#managing-accounts">Managing accounts<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Customers with a Link by Stripe account can manage their account via <a href="https://link.co/">the Link by Stripe website</a>, where they can add and remove payments methods and addresses, learn more about the security of Link by Stripe, and delete their Link by Stripe account if they wish. The <a href="https://support.link.co/">Link by Stripe documentation</a> has guidance on how to perform these tasks.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="caveats"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#caveats">Caveats<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>While Link by Stripe may seem similar to Apple Pay or Google Pay, the way it works is slightly different, so there are a few things to note.</p>



<ul>
<li>Link by Stripe does not support checkout pages built with WooCommerce Blocks yet.</li>



<li>The settings that are available for Apple Pay and Google Pay do not apply to Link by Stripe.</li>



<li>Link by Stripe will always show on the checkout page only, not the product or cart pages.</li>



<li>If the new checkout experience is disabled, Link by Stripe will also be disabled automatically.</li>
</ul>
