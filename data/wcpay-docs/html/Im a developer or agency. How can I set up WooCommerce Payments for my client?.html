			<div class="entry">
				
<p>If you are a developer or agency setting up a site for a client, and the client plans on using WooCommerce Payments, there a few things to keep in mind as you get started building and configuring the site for them.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="use-dev-mode"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#use-dev-mode">Use Dev Mode<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>To test how WooCommerce Payments functions with the client’s other plugins and themes, you can <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/dev-mode/">use Dev Mode</a> on a staging site. This allows you to set up a WooCommerce Payments test account without entering any personal information, yours or your client’s.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="have-client-sign-up"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#have-client-sign-up">Have the client sign up<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>If you’re setting up WooCommerce Payments for someone else (i.e. a client), it’s best to have them <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/#signing-up">complete the account creation process</a> on the live site themselves. This is because it’s not always possible to change all the account information once it’s been saved.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="requesting-support"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#requesting-support">Requesting support<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Our support policies prevent us from discussing specific details of a WooCommerce Payments account unless we are contacted directly from one of the following emails:</p>



<ul>
<li>The email address on the connected <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/connection/">WordPress.com account</a>.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/update-my-contact-details-wc-payments/#section-2">account email</a> on the Stripe Express account.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ideally, both of these email addresses would still be the client’s, even if the site was developed by a third party. Thus, as the builder or agency, it’s unlikely that you will be able to submit support requests on behalf of your client.</p>



<p>If you do need to submit a support request on behalf of your client, please provide us with one of the two email addresses listed above. That way, we can first verify with the client that we are permitted to discuss their account with you.</p>



<p>That said, note that we are happy to answer <em>general</em> questions about WooCommerce Payments functionality, regardless of which email address you contact us from. As such, it’s possible that your support request may not require verification at all.</p>
