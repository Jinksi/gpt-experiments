			<div class="entry">
				
<p>Due to restrictions from our payments processor and their service providers, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/restricted-products/">some businesses and product types</a> are not allowed to transact using WooCommerce Payments. This restriction includes CBD products.</p>



<p>We are working with our payments partners to make it possible to sell CBD via WooCommerce Payments. However, for now, merchants selling CBD must use <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/square/">Square</a> or <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/viva-wallet-for-woocommerce/">Viva Wallet</a>.</p>



<p>Learn more about selling CBD with WooCommerce in our <a href="https://woocommerce.com/sell-cbd-online/">guidelines for CBD and other hemp-derived products</a>.</p>
