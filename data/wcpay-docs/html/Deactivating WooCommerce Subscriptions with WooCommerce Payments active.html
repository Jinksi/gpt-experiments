			<div class="entry">
				
<p>If you’re using&nbsp;<a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/">WooCommerce Payments</a>, you have two options to sell subscription products:</p>



<ul>
<li>The subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments, or…</li>



<li>The separate&nbsp;<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/">WooCommerce Subscriptions</a>&nbsp;extension.</li>
</ul>



<p>This document reviews what happens if you are using WooCommerce Payments in addition to the Subscriptions extension, and then you deactivate the Subscriptions extension under <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong> in your WordPress dashboard.</p>



<div class="wp-block-coblocks-alert is-style-warning" aria-label="Alert section of type warning"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-alert__title"><strong>NOTE:</strong> WooCommerce Subscriptions and the WooCommerce Payments subscriptions functionality have some <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions-basics/comparison/">differences in features</a>. Please be sure that you are not using any of the features exclusive to the Subscriptions extension before deactivating it.</p></div>

<p>If you go to <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong> and click the <strong>Deactivate</strong> link for the Subscriptions extension, a popup will warn you of the consequences of doing so:</p>

<p>To deactivate Subscriptions, click <strong>Yes, deactivate WooCommerce Subscriptions</strong>. Otherwise, click <strong>Cancel</strong> to keep WooCommerce Subscriptions activated.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="existing-subscriptions"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#existing-subscriptions">Effects on existing subscriptions<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Existing subscriptions will be set to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/renewal-process/#section-4">manual renewal</a> as soon as the Subscriptions extension is deactivated. This means that, on their next renewal date, your subscribers will get an email with a link to log into your site and pay for their renewal by hand.</p>



<p>After the customer has manually renewed one time, WooCommerce Payments will “take over” the subscription and automatic payments will resume.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="new-subscriptions"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#new-subscriptions">Effects on new subscriptions<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>New subscriptions will start with WooCommerce Payments from the first transaction, and as such will not need to renewal manually.</p>
