			<div class="entry">
				
<p>Although WooCommerce Payments makes charging your customers as easy as possible, it’s still helpful to be familiar with the various ways in which money can move through your site and your account. This document explains how WooCommerce Payments presents information to you about where your money came from and where it’s going.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="deposits"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#deposits">Deposits<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Deposits are when some or all of your account balance is sent to your bank account or debit card. (These <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/deposits-and-payouts/">may also be called</a> “payouts.”) Deposits almost always <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/deposit-schedule/">occur automatically</a>. Eligible merchants can also request <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/instant-deposits/">instant deposits</a>.</p>



<p>WooCommerce Payments provides all the relevant information about your deposits under the <strong>Payments &gt; Deposits</strong> menu. On that page, you can do the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>View a list containing all past and future (“estimated”) deposits.</li>



<li>See each deposit date, amount, and the account to which it was sent.</li>



<li>View which transactions are associated with each given deposit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each deposit has a status associated with it. Here are the common ones and what they mean:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Paid:</strong> The deposit was successfully sent to your bank.</li>



<li><strong>In Transit:</strong> The deposit is on the way to your bank account, but not there yet.</li>



<li><strong>Pending:</strong> The deposit has not occurred yet, and future transactions can still be added to it.</li>



<li><strong>Estimated:</strong> The deposit has not occurred yet, but future transactions <em>cannot</em> be added to it.</li>



<li><strong>Failed:</strong> There was a problem with the deposit. It will be retried in 24 hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your account balance ever <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/why-is-my-account-showing-a-negative-balance/">becomes negative</a>, you may also see a <strong>Withdrawal</strong> transaction type in the <strong>Payments &gt; Deposits</strong> list. Withdrawals represent a <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/withdrawals/">debit from your bank account</a> to cover the negative account balance.</p>



<p>By clicking on any deposit, you can open the deposit details page, where more information about that particular deposit is shown. Most importantly, the separate transactions that all went into the deposit are listed.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Optionally enter something in the <em>Reason for refund</em> box.</li>



<li>Click the <strong>Refund via WooCommerce Payments</strong> button.</li>
</ol>



<p>The charge amount <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees-refund/">plus transaction fees</a> will be deducted from your account balance and returned to the customer’s original payment method.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="refund-durations"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#refund-durations">Refund durations<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>Refunds are processed immediately. However, depending on the customer’s bank, it can take anywhere from 5 to 10 business days before they get their money back in their account.</p>



<p>If your customer doesn’t see the refund after 10 business days and the original charge is still visible on their bank statement, they should contact their bank for more information.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="reversals"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#reversals">Reversals<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>If a refund is sent within a few hours of the original purchase, the refund might be processed as a “reversal.” What this means is that the original charge will drop off the customer’s bank statement, and a separate credit is not issued.</p>



<p>Thus, if you refund a customer soon after they ordered, but they never seen the amount added back to their statement, you can simply ask them to review their statement <em>for the original charge</em>. It should be gone, as if they never transacted with you at all.</p>

<p>A dispute (also called a “chargeback”) occurs when a card owner questions a payment with their bank.

<p>WooCommerce Payments provides all the relevant information about your disputes under the <strong>Payments &gt; Disputes</strong> menu. This page includes information such as when the charge was disputed, the amount, the status, and deadline for responding.</p>
