			<div class="entry">
				
<p>High-performance order storage (HPOS), formerly known as custom order tables (COT), is the name given to a new way in which the core WooCommerce plugin plans to store data inside the WordPress database. Please see <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/high-performance-order-storage/">this page</a> for additional information.</p>



<p>As of version 5.5.0, WooCommerce Payments is compatible with HPOS and should function with it enabled. However, <strong>HPOS itself is still considered experimental</strong>, and should only be enabled on staging or test environments. It is not yet ready for use on production sites.</p>
