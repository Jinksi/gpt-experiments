<p>We offer a 90-day return policy for card readers purchased from WooCommerce.com.</p>



<p>Readers must be in their original packaging and in good condition. You must return all products, cords, cables, parts, and documentation included in the original packaging. Your refund will be applied to the original payment method on file.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to start your return, please do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Locate your order number using the original order confirmation email.</li>



<li><a href="https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/">Contact support</a> and enter “Return Card Reader” in the <em>Subject</em> box.</li>



<li>Our support team will assist you with returning the reader.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re outside of the 90-day return window, we will not accept your return. However, because we want to ensure that you have the best customer experience possible, we are happy to help you troubleshoot or work through any issue with your card reader.&nbsp;</p>
