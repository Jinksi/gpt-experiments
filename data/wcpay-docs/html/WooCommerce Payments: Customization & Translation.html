			<div class="entry">
				
<p>Although WooCommerce Payments is intended to be a payment gateway that does not require you to fiddle with settings, there are some customizations you can make to various features.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="customization"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#customization">Customization<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Most settings are covered in the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/">Startup Guide</a> or the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/settings-guide/">Settings Guide</a>. However, there are a few settings covered here:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/can-i-change-the-title-and-description-of-the-payment-gateway-shown-during-checkout/">Can I change the title and description shown during checkout?</a></li>



<li><a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/bank-statement-descriptor/">Requirements and recommendations for bank statement descriptor</a></li>
</ul>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="translation"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#translation">Translation<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>When you install or update WooCommerce Payments, WordPress will automatically look for a translation file in your language and download it if one is available. That said, we have not yet translated WooCommerce Payments into every major language.</p>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/translations/">Our Translations document</a> explains which languages we have translations for, and how to translate WooCommerce Payments into your language if we do not yet support it.</p>



<p>If you wish to contribute to the translation of WooCommerce Payments, you can do so using our <a href="https://translate.wordpress.com/">GlotPress translation site</a>. The WooCommerce Payments project is <a href="https://translate.wordpress.com/projects/woocommerce/woocommerce-payments/">here</a>.</p>
