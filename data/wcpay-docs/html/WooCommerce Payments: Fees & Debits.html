			<div class="entry">
				
<p>WooCommerce Payments uses a “pay-as-you-go” pricing model. In other words, there are no setup fees, monthly fees, or other hidden charges. Instead, our fees are deducted directly from each payment made via WooCommerce Payments.</p>



<p>The exact fees we charge differ based on various factors, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The country your business is located in.</li>



<li>The country your customer is located in.</li>



<li>The currency with which the customer paid.</li>



<li>The payment method chosen by the customer.</li>
</ul>



<p>Please see <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/">our full list of fees</a> for a detailed breakdown. Also note that <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees-refund/">fees are not refunded</a> when you issue refunds to your customers.</p>

<p>WooCommerce Payments <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/currency-conversion/">charges foreign exchange fees</a> when the currency of the payment differs from the currency of your deposit account. It may also be helpful to know <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fee-currency/">what currency is used to determine these fees</a>.</p>

<p>Your WooCommerce Payments balance <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/why-is-my-account-showing-a-negative-balance/">can become negative</a> for a few reasons. In some cases, this may cause WooCommerce Payments to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/withdrawals/">debit your connected bank account</a> to recover from the negative balance. In other cases, incoming charges will cause the balance to rise over time, until it becomes positive again and deposits resume as normal.</p>
