			<div class="entry">
				
<p>The WooCommerce Payments “Things to do” checklist helps you to manage important tasks related to your store. This checklist will appear on the <strong>Payments &gt; Overview</strong> screen when there are tasks that require attention.</p>



<p>For example, if your store has disputed payments that are awaiting a response, a task will appear to help you resolve these disputes.</p>

<p>To keep your store and WooCommerce Payments account running smoothly, it is recommended that you attend to any tasks that appear on this checklist. You can take action by clicking on a task or, in some cases, dismissing a task using the three dots menu to the side.</p>
