			<div class="entry">
				
<p>If your business sells alcohol to customers in Canada or the U.S., you must <a href="https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/">contact support</a> for approval. We try to review all requests for approval within 7 business days, and we reserve the right to approve or reject merchants at our discretion.</p>



<p>For merchants in other countries, <em>our</em> approval is not required, but you must ensure that <em>Stripe themselves</em> do not <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses">prohibit alcohol sales in your region</a>. If alcohol sales in your region are permitted by Stripe, you are clear to sell alcohol using WooCommerce Payments.</p>
