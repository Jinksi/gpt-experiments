			<div class="entry">
				
<p>Yes, WooCommerce Payments supports 3D Secure (also known as “3DS” or “SCA”) on both the checkout page and the Pay For Order page.</p>



<p>To test the checkout flow on your store with the additional 3D Secure verification step, you can use a <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/#section-7">3D Secure test card</a> while WooCommerce Payments is in <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/">test mode</a>.</p>
