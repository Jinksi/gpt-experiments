<p>In 2022, there were a few changes to the process for issuing 1099-Ks. The process is outlined below. We have built WooCommerce Payments <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/">in partnership with Stripe</a>, thus expect some communication from Stripe with regard to your 1099-K.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="updates-for-2022"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#updates-for-2022">Updates for the 2022 tax year<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>For the 2022 tax year, the U.S. threshold for issuing 1099-K’s has been reduced from $20,000 to $600. As such, if you have processed over $600 in payments in 2022, you will receive a 1099-K tax form.</p>



<div class="wp-block-coblocks-alert" aria-label="Alert section"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-alert__title"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> On December 23rd, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-delay-for-implementation-of-600-reporting-threshold-for-third-party-payment-platforms-forms-1099-k">IRS announced&nbsp;a delay</a> to the lowering of the 1099-K reporting threshold&nbsp;until next tax year. This means that, for tax year 2022, the 1099-K filing threshold will remain the same as for tax year 2021: $20,000 or more in payments from over 200 transactions. 1099-K forms sent to you via the Stripe Express dashboard have already been updated in consideration of the new threshold. If you are below the threshold, a 1099-K will not be available for you.</p></div>



<p><strong>Verification Phase</strong>: On or around November 28, 2022, merchants who are eligible to receive a 1099-K will be sent a verification email from WooCommerce Payments and Stripe. This email will have a link for you to confirm your identity, tax information, as well as provide you with the option to consent to <strong>e-delivery</strong> (meaning you will receive your 1099-K form electronically if you consent). <em>We recommend adding express@stripe.com to your address book so the email isn’t marked as spam.</em></p>

<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="what-is-form-1099k"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#what-is-form-1099k">What is Form 1099-K?<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>Form 1099-K is an information filing required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States. WooCommerce Payments is required to issue a 1099-K to U.S. persons with payments processed that exceed the following thresholds:</p>



<ul>
<li>For returns for the calendar year 2022:
<ul>
<li>Gross payments that exceed $600&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>For returns for calendar years prior to 2022:
<ul>
<li>Gross payments that exceed $20,000, and…</li>



<li>More than 200 such transactions</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>For returns for calendar years after 2021:
<ul>
<li>Gross payments for goods or services that exceed $600, and…</li>



<li>Any number of transactions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional information can be found <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k">on the IRS website</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend consulting with your tax advisor for additional information and to understand which threshold applies in your state.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="why-did-i-receive-a-1099k"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#why-did-i-receive-a-1099k">Why did I receive a Form 1099-K?<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>We issue a 1099-K if a merchant meets either the federal filing threshold or a lower threshold applicable in their state.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="didnt-meet-irs-threshold"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#didnt-meet-irs-threshold">What if I didn’t meet the IRS threshold, but still got a form?<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>A 1099-K may be issued for a few reasons, even if the IRS threshold is not met:</p>



<ul>
<li>Many states have a lower threshold than the federal government. A form will be filed if either the state or federal threshold is met.</li>



<li>There are multiple accounts with the same tax identification number (TIN). Accounts using the same TIN are combined to determine if a filing is required. Even if all accounts are <em>individually</em> below the filing threshold, each account under the same TIN will receive a 1099-K if the <em>combined</em> total transaction and payment volumes exceed the threshold.
<ul>
<li>A TIN, or Tax Identification Number is the number used for business reporting by the IRS. This may be the owner’s Social Security Number (SSN), or an Employer Identification Number (EIN), which you can get via the IRS website. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employer-id-numbers">More information here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A 1099-K includes gross sales, without regard to refunds, fees, chargebacks, or other reductions.</p>

<p>Because a 1099-K is required to include gross sales, it will include amounts that are not deposited into your bank account, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Refunds</li>



<li>Fees</li>



<li>Disputed charges</li>



<li>Funds reserved</li>



<li>Transactions that haven’t been deposited yet</li>
