			<div class="entry">
				
<p>With WooCommerce Payments, you have two options to sell subscription products:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/">built-in subscriptions functionality</a>.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/">WooCommerce Subscriptions</a> extension.</li>
</ul>



<p>See <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/comparison/">this document</a> for a comparison between the two.</p>



<p>This document explains what happens to subscriptions when the WooCommerce Payments gateway <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/#section-2">is disabled</a> in the settings. It does not cover what happens if you <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/built-in-subscriptions/deactivate/">deactivate the WooCommerce Payments plugin</a> itself.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="existing-subscriptions"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#existing-subscriptions">Existing subscriptions<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Disabling the WooCommerce Payments gateway only affects the payment options displayed in the WooCommerce checkout form. Because existing subscriptions renew automatically <em>without</em> going through the checkout form, they will not be affected. In other words, existing subscribers will continue to renew via WooCommerce Payments without issue.</p>



<p>This applies to all subscriptions that renew automatically, regardless of whether or not you use the Subscriptions extension in conjunction with WooCommerce Payments. </p>



<p>If you use the Subscriptions extension and have some subscribers that <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/renewal-process/#section-4">renew manually</a>, they will still be able to renew using any payment gateways that remain enabled.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="new-subscriptions"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#new-subscriptions">New subscriptions<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>When using the subscriptions functionality built-in to WooCommerce Payments, subscription purchases can only be processed via WooCommerce Payments. Other payment gateways will not be available during checkout when a subscription product is in the cart.</p>



<p>For this reason, if WooCommerce Payments is installed and active, but disabled as a gateway, customers with subscription products in their cart will see a notice saying that there are no available payment methods which support subscriptions.</p>

<p>To allow customers to buy subscriptions again, you will either need to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/">Subscriptions extension</a> and <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/payment-gateways/">a compatible gateway</a>.</li>



<li>Enable WooCommerce Payments as a gateway again.</li>
</ul>
