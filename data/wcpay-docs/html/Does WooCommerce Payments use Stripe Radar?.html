			<div class="entry">
				
<p>Yes, WooCommerce Payments utilizes <a href="https://stripe.com/radar">Stripe Radar</a>, providing merchants with protection against risky transactions and card testers using Stripeâ€™s machine learning technology.</p>



<p>The Radar rules for WooCommerce Payments accounts are managed by our team and, aside from the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/fraud-prevention/#address-verification">post/ZIP code verification</a> checks, cannot be modified by merchants.
