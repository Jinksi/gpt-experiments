<p>WooCommerce Payments is <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/">built in partnership with Stripe</a>, our payments processor. This means that, during the signup process for WooCommerce Payments, a special kind of Stripe account will be created for you, called a Stripe Express account. </p>



<p>The documentation pages below explain how to access this account, how to change information in the account, and answer other questions you might have.</p>



<div class="wp-block-coblocks-alert" aria-label="Alert section"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-alert__title"><strong>NOTE:</strong> A Stripe Express account is different from a regular Stripe account, which is what you’d get if you simply visited Stripe.com and signed up there. See the <a href="#regular-stripe-accounts">Regular Stripe accounts</a> section for details on how WooCommerce Payments does and does not interact with regular Stripe accounts.</p></div>

<p>Although WooCommerce Payments is designed to integrate pretty closely with your existing WordPress dashboard, sometimes you might need to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/access-stripe-account/">access your Stripe Express account</a> directly. (For example, to&nbsp;update your bank information&nbsp;or&nbsp;your tax ID number.) Please see the linked guide for instructions on how to access the Stripe Express account.</p>

<p>There are various bits of information that can only be updated directly in your Stripe Express account. Some common examples are:</p>
