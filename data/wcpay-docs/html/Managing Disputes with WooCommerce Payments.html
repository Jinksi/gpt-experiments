			<div class="entry">
				
<p>A dispute is when a customer contests a payment made with their card. Handling disputes from customers can be one of the most unpleasant parts of running a business, especially when you need to challenge a dispute. However, not responding to your disputes can be problematic, because it can lead to fines and the possibility of being prohibited to do business by the card networks.</p>



<p>This guide provides you with guidance on how to respond to existing disputes. For more information on how to prevent disputes in the first place, please see <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/preventing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/">this document</a>.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="section-1"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-1">Overview<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>WooCommerce Payments guides you through the process of responding to a dispute via the <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/#section-7"><b>Payments &gt; Disputes</b> page</a>. This document expands on information provided within those pages, and provides advice about the types of responses recommended for different types of disputes.</p>



<p>For each dispute type, it also provides the information required to overturn the dispute, and where to include that evidence in the fields presented by the <b>Challenge Dispute</b> form. When responding to a dispute, it’s always best to provide more information. If you have any information you think the card issuer might want to see, submit it as dispute evidence.&nbsp;Some example dispute evidence includes web logs, email communications, shipment tracking numbers, delivery confirmations, proof of prior refunds, replacement shipments, and so on.</p>

<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="section-2"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-2">Responding to a dispute<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>After your store receives a dispute, you can respond in one or three ways:</p>



<ul>
<li><b>Do nothing</b>: in which case, the dispute will be marked <i>Lost</i> after the due date is reached.</li>



<li><b>Accept dispute</b>: accepting the dispute immediately marks it as <i>Lost</i>. The funds withdrawn from your account to cover the transaction and <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/">dispute fee</a> will not be reimbursed.</li>



<li><b>Challenge dispute</b>: submit evidence to card issuer proving that the dispute is not valid. The evidence will be reviewed by the card issuer and you will receive their determination at a later date, which can be a number of months in future.</li>
</ul>



<div class="wp-block-coblocks-alert is-style-warning" aria-label="Alert section of type warning"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-alert__title"><strong>NOTE:</strong> One thing you should <strong>not</strong> do is refund the customer for their disputed order using some other method besides WooCommerce Payments. This is because, if you lose the dispute later on, the amount of the order will automatically be refunded to them from your WooCommerce Payments account. Thus, you will then have lost <strong>two times</strong> the amount of the order, plus the $15 dispute fee.</p></div>



<p>The first two responses are the most efficient way to resolve a dispute. If you think the dispute is valid, or do not have the required evidence to challenge the dispute, you should accept the dispute. The card networks do not take into account the number of disputes you lose when determining the risk of your business. They look at the number of disputes your business receives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/woocommerce-payments-dispute-details.png?w=736" alt="" class="wp-image-2550115"></figure>



<p class="woo-sc-box note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you decide to challenge a dispute, evidence can only be submitted one time. For that reason, be sure to carefully review any evidence you plan to submit! Once the evidence has been submitted, it’s not possible (even for WooCommerce Payments support staff) to correct any mistakes.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="section-3"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-3">Contact your customer<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>With any dispute, we recommend that you contact your customer to discuss the claim. Sometimes, customers may mistakenly dispute a charge and once reminded of the transaction, they can withdraw the dispute with their card issuer.</p>



<p>Importantly, even if your customer does withdraw the dispute, you still need to challenge the dispute in order for the transaction to be refunded and dispute fee returned. It will also still take approximately 75 days to be closed by the card issuer.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="section-4"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-4">Dispute types<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Card issuers categorize disputes in one of the following ways, base on the claim by the card holder:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#credit-not-processed">Credit not processed</a></strong>: card holder claims they are owed a refund or other credit that has not been received. For example, if your customer returns a product, but the charge has not been refunded to the card.</li>



<li><strong><a href="#duplicate">Duplicate</a></strong>: customer claims multiple charges were placed on their card for the same product or service. For example, if your customer paid for a service when booking via your website, as well as in person after receiving the service.</li>



<li><strong><a href="#fraudulent">Fraudulent</a></strong>: card holder, not necessarily the customer with your store, claims they did not authorize the payment with your store. For example, if your customer used a stolen credit card number to place an order, the holder of that card may later see the transaction and dispute it as it is not recognized.</li>



<li><strong><a href="#general">General</a> or <a href="#unrecognized">Unrecognized</a>:</strong> the card holder notifies their card issuer that they do not recognize the charge on their card statement.</li>



<li><strong><a href="#product-not-received">Product not received</a></strong>: the good or service for which the charge was processed has not been received by the customer. For example, a shipment from your business has not been received by your customer.</li>



<li><strong><a href="#product-unacceptable">Product unacceptable</a></strong>: the card holder claims the product or service they received in return for the payment was defective, damaged, or not as described. For example, your customer was shipped a different item to the one purchased.</li>



<li><strong><a href="#subscription-cancelled">Subscription cancelled</a></strong>: after cancelling a subscription plan, the customer was charged a recurring payment for that subscription. For example, if a customer calls your business to request cancellation, but the subscription is not cancelled within WooCommerce.</li>
</ul>



<p>Because each type of dispute represents a different claim by the customer, each requires different evidence to be submitted when challenging the dispute. The rest of this document outlines the different types of disputes, and evidence required to challenge each. This information is based on guidance from Stripe, our <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/powered-by-stripe/">payments partner</a>, on <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/categories">dispute evidence for each category</a>.</p>



<div id="credit-not-processed" class="hidden-div-for-anchor">&nbsp;</div>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="section-5"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-5">Credit Not Processed<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>To overturn a <strong>credit not processed</strong> dispute, you need to demonstrate either that:</p>



<ol>
<li>Your customer is not entitled to a refund based on your store’s refund policy; or</li>



<li>You have refunded your customer outside of the card network, e.g., via store credit.</li>
</ol>



<h4 id="h-additional-details-text">Additional details text</h4>



<p>In the <strong>Additional Details</strong> text field of the <strong>Payments &gt; Disputes &gt; Challenge Dispute</strong> screen, your response should include the following information:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Disclosure of refund policy</strong>: explain how and when your refund policy was disclosed to the customer prior to purchase.</li>



<li><strong>Reason for refund refusal</strong>: if you have refused to refund the customer, explain to the bank why the customer is not entitled to a refund. Reference terms in your refund policy, uploaded in the <strong>additional details file</strong> field.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-additional-details-file">Additional details file</h4>



<p>In the <strong>Additional Details</strong> file upload field of the <strong>Payments &gt; Disputes &gt; Challenge Dispute</strong> screen, upload a PDF of your refund policy, as presented to the customer. Do not link to the refund policy within your response, as links will not be visited by the card issuer evaluating the dispute.</p>



<div id="duplicate" class="hidden-div-for-anchor">&nbsp;</div>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="section-6"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-6">Duplicate<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>To overturn a <strong>duplicate</strong> charge dispute, you need to demonstrate that each payment was for a separate product or service.</p>



<h4 id="h-additional-details-text-1">Additional details text</h4>



<p>In the <strong>Additional Details</strong> text field of the <strong>Payments &gt; Disputes &gt; Challenge Dispute</strong> screen, your response should include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Duplicate charge ID:</strong> the charge ID for the previous payment that appears to be a duplicate of the one that is disputed —the charge ID will look like this: <code>ch_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</code>, notice it starts with <code>ch_</code>. This ID is available on the transaction from the <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Edit Order</strong> screen, or the <strong>Payments &gt; Transactions</strong> screen.</li>



<li><strong>Duplicate charge explanation</strong>: explain to the bank the difference between the disputed payment and the prior one that appears to be a duplicate, referencing documentation uploaded in the <strong>additional details file</strong> field.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-additional-details-file-1">Additional details file</h4>



<p>In the <strong>Additional Details</strong> file upload field of the <strong>Payments &gt; Disputes &gt; Challenge Dispute</strong> screen, upload a document for the prior payment that can uniquely identify it, such as a separate receipt. This document should be paired with a similar document from the disputed payment that proves the two are separate.</p>



<p>If the dispute is on a charge for a <strong>physical product</strong>, this should also include a separate shipping label for both this charge and the other payment. If multiple products were shipped together, provide a packing list that shows each purchase.</p>



<p>If the dispute is on a charge for an <strong>offline service</strong>, provide a copy of the service agreement.</p>



<div id="fraudulent" class="hidden-div-for-anchor">&nbsp;</div>

<p>To overturn a <strong>fraudulent</strong> charge dispute, you need to prove to the card issuer that the cardholder authorized the transaction. The cardholder may not be the same person as the customer with your store.</p>

<p>You should also prove that the customer was aware of your cancellation policies and procedure. For example, demonstrate that the customer accepted the cancellation terms at the time of sign-up.</p>

<p>Visa has special evidence requirements for overturning Fraudulent and Product Not Received disputes. These requirements are referred to as <em>compelling evidence</em>.</p>



<p>In order for Visa to consider a response for a <strong>fraudulent</strong> or <strong>product not received</strong> dispute, you must provide at least one piece of compelling evidence. This evidence proves that the cardholder participated in the transaction, received any goods or services, or benefited from the transaction.</p>



<p>While compelling evidence is only required by Visa, we recommended you collect and submit this evidence regardless of the card brand used in the transaction.</p>



<p>You can learn more about Visa’s compelling evidence requirements in <a href="https://www.visauniversity.com/en/catalog/liveonline/introduction-to-dispute-resolution">their online courses</a>.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="section-28"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-28">Dispute Decisions<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Although WooCommerce Payments is used to submit evidence and challenge the dispute, the dispute outcome is determined exclusively by the bank. Neither Automattic nor our financial service providers influence the decision outside of submitting the evidence to them. Unfortunately once decided, these decisions can not be overturned.</p>



<p>On average, banks take 2 to 3 months after evidence has been submitted to determine the outcome of a dispute.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="section-29"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#section-29">SEPA Disputes<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Like other payment methods, SEPA provides a dispute process for customers to dispute payments. However, their dispute process works differently than that of other payment methods.</p>



<p>After paying with SEPA, customers can dispute a payment through their bank on a “no questions asked” basis up to eight weeks after their account is debited. <strong>The customer will automatically win any dispute filed within this time period.</strong></p>



<p>After eight weeks and up to 13 months, a customer can only dispute a payment with their bank if the debit is considered unauthorized. If this occurs, WooCommerce Payments automatically provides the bank with the mandate that the customer approved. This does not guarantee cancellation of the dispute however: the bank can still decide that the debit was unauthorized and the customer is entitled to a refund.</p>
