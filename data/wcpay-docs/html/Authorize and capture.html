<div class="wp-block-coblocks-alert is-style-warning" aria-label="Alert section of type warning"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-alert__title">Our suggestion is that you <strong>leave the authorize and capture later setting disabled</strong> unless you have a very specific and well-justified use case in mind. If you do need or want to enable it, please read the entirety of this document!</p></div>



<p>Card transactions occur very quickly, which is what makes them convenient. In fact, they happen so fast that many people don’t realize that there are actually <em>two</em> events taking place: an authorization and a capture.</p>



<p>By default, WooCommerce Payments will perform the authorization and capture at the same time. However, by enabling the <strong>Issue an authorization on checkout, and capture later</strong> setting, you can prevent WooCommerce Payments from automatically capturing charges. This allows you to manually capture the charge at a later time.</p>



<p>Although most merchants won’t need to use this feature, it may be helpful in certain scenarios. This document explains a bit more about how authorizations and captures work, and provides some example uses cases for which enabling the option might be a good idea.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="authorize-vs-capture"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#authorize-vs-capture">What is an authorization vs. a capture?<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>An <strong>authorization</strong> is the first part of the charge process, in which the payment processor connects to the bank that issued the customer’s card and determines if the customer has enough money to cover the transaction cost. During this step, the funds are “held” or reserved for payment, but not actually sent to the merchant yet.</p>



<p>A <strong>capture</strong> (also known as “settlement”) occurs when the merchant instructs the payment processor to transfer some or all of the held funds from the customer’s account to their own. The customer’s bank then sends the requested amount of money. The merchant also has the option of cancelling the authorization.</p>



<p>Notably, authorizations are temporary in nature. They must be captured within seven days or the authorization will automatically expire. If that happens, the reserved funds are freed back up in the customer’s account.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="when-is-manual-capture-helpful"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#when-is-manual-capture-helpful">When is manual capture helpful?<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Manually capturing authorizations is usually used in scenarios where some payment is needed up-front, but the exact final amount is not known initially.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of some common examples where this workflow is used:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gas/petrol stations where you “pay at the pump” issue an authorization before you beginning filling up your vehicle. When you’re done, and the exact amount of the charge is known to their system, they will capture that amount. </li>



<li>Hotels have an even longer time between when the charge is authorized (usually at check-in) and when the charge is captured (usually at check-out).</li>



<li>Equipment rental businesses may request a card so that they can issue an authorization prior to allowing their customers to take the equipment home.</li>



<li>Craftsmen who take custom orders (for a piece of furniture, say) might decide to authorize a customer’s card ahead of time and capture a different amount later on, depending on the exact work involved in the customer’s request.</li>
</ul>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="manual-capture-disadvantages"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#manual-capture-disadvantages">Manual capture disadvantages<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>As you can see above, there are a few limited situations where authorizing first and capturing later are needed. However, for the vast majority of merchants using WooCommerce Payments, authorizing and capturing separately has several disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Authorizations are temporary: they expire after seven days. If you don’t capture them in time, the customer will need to start the purchase process all over again. You might not even notice that you did not capture the charge until after you have shipped the customer their goods!</li>



<li>You cannot capture more than the amount originally authorized. If you initially authorize too little, you will need to cancel that authorization and have the customer repurchase.</li>



<li>The authorize and capture workflow only supports cards. It does not support any <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/additional-payment-methods/">local payment methods</a>, which can cause inconvenience for your customers.</li>
</ul>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="enabling-auth-and-capture"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#enabling-auth-and-capture">Enabling authorize and capture later<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>If, after considering the above, you wish to enable authorize first and capture later, you can do that like so:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Payments &gt; Settings</strong> in your site’s dashboard.</li>



<li>In the <em>Transactions</em> section, check the box next to “Issue an authorization on checkout, and capture later.”</li>



<li>A popup will appear to ask if you are sure. Click <strong>Enable</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll to the bottom and click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re using our <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/additional-payment-methods/">new checkout experience</a> and have any local payment methods enabled, a warning will be shown stating that they cannot be used while authorize and capture is enabled.</p>

<p>There are two ways to capture an authorized order, from the <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Orders</strong> page or via <strong>Payments &gt; Transactions</strong>. They both do the same thing, but the latter method is faster if you have multiple orders that need to be captured.</p>



<p>The video below gives a brief overview of how to capture a payment, and we also have more detailed instructions below.</p>

<p>If a customer wishes to cancel their order after it’s been authorized but before it’s been captured, you can do so using steps below.</p>



<p>Although authorizations expire automatically after seven days, it’s best to cancel them if you’ve confirmed that you won’t need to charge the customer. Doing so releases the hold their bank placed on their funds.</p>



<p>To cancel an authorization:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Orders</strong> in your site’s dashboard.</li>



<li>Find the order you wish to cancel and click to open it.</li>



<li>In the <em>Order Actions</em> box, use the dropdown to select <strong>Cancel authorization</strong>.</li>



<li>Click the <strong>Update</strong> button.</li>
</ol>



<p>The order status will be set to Cancelled and a note will be added:</p>
