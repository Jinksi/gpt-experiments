			<div class="entry">
				
<p>When attempting to access the Stripe dashboard via the <em>Forgot Password</em> feature with the email address connected to your WooCommerce Payments account, you may encounter the following error:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This account is linked to a business that works with Stripe. To view details, sign in to their website or app directly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While your activity with WooCommerce Payments is backed by <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/">a Stripe Express account</a>, it is <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/access-stripe-account/#section-1">not possible to login to Stripe.com</a> with the email address used to create your WooCommerce Payments account.</p>



<p>Instead, to access the Stripe account connected to WooCommerce Payments, you need to use the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/access-stripe-account/">login link provided within your WooCommerce siteâ€™s dashboard</a>.</p>
