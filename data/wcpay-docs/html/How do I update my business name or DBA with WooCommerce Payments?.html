			<div class="entry">
				
<p>If you created your WooCommerce Payments account for a company, you can update the name your business operates under by adding a “Doing business as” (DBA) name.</p>



<p>The process of changing your DBA name is exactly the same as the process for <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/tax-id-changes/">updating your tax ID</a>, so you can use those instructions to update your DBA as well.</p>



<div class="wp-block-coblocks-alert" aria-label="Alert section"><p class="wp-block-coblocks-alert__title"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The “Doing business as” name is only available on accounts created as a company entity. It is not available on individual accounts.</p></div>
