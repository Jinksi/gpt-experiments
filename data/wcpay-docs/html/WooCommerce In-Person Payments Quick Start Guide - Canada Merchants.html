<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="charge-the-reader"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#charge-the-reader">Charge the card reader<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>Charge the card reader using the supplied charging cable for approximately 2-3 hours. Charging before the first use helps to prevent potential damage to it. A battery-level indicator icon will appear at the top-left of the device screen to help track the level of the charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> With typical usage, you should charge the reader once a day. A fully charged reader can run ~600-800 transactions on a single charge.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="turn-on-the-reader"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#turn-on-the-reader">Turn on the card reader<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>After charging, turn on the device by briefly pressing the power button located at the top right of the PIN pad on the reader. The display powers on and shows the device’s splash screen. The display dims after a few seconds of inactivity. If inactive and disconnected from your application for more than 5 minutes, it will beep and power off. You can turn off the WisePad 3 manually by pressing and holding the power button until the LED display shows a “Power off?” prompt, then press the green enter button to confirm.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="enable-your-device-bluetooth"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#enable-your-device-bluetooth">Enable your device Bluetooth<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p class="woo-sc-box info"><strong><strong>Before you start: </strong></strong>Do not pair the card reader in your device’s Bluetooth settings. The WooCommerce Mobile App will manage the connection automatically.</p>



<p>Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your device. Open the WooCommerce Mobile App. Navigate to <strong>Settings (Gear Icon) &gt; In-Person Payments &gt; Manage Card Reader.</strong> </p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="connect-via-the-app"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#connect-via-the-app">Connect via the WooCommerce Mobile App<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>Click on Connect Card Reader. If prompted, allow the app to see your location while using the app.</p>



<p>Select the card reader when prompted (it will show the card reader’s serial number) on your smartphone/tablet. Then, pair your device with the WisePad 3 with Pairing PIN. And now your WisePad 3 card reader is connected. In order to accept payments, ensure that “test mode” is disabled for your WooCommerce Payments account. The reader will stay connected to your iOS or Android device while in standby and automatically exits standby mode when you resume activity. You can turn off the WisePad 3 manually by pressing and holding the power button until the LED display shows a “Power off?” prompt, then press the green enter button to confirm. </p>



<p class="woo-sc-box info"></p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you would like to use the card reader for collecting payment in person for orders placed online, such as for curbside or local pickup, you will need to make some changes in your store WP Admin settings by following the instructions in <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/getting-started-with-in-person-payments-with-woocommerce-payments/#section-2">our documentation</a>. This includes setting up a local pickup zone, enabling cash on delivery, and making sure your products are set to this zone.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="collect-payment"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#collect-payment">Collect Payment<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>To collect a payment for an order placed online by your customer(s) for local pickup, navigate to that order in your WooCommerce Mobile App and click on Collect Payment to finish the transaction. Then tap or insert the credit card to accept the payment. For PIN-based payments, insert the card and complete using the WisePad 3 PIN pad.</p>



<p>If you need to take a quick payment on the go, use the Simple Payments feature. Navigate to the Orders tab in the mobile app, click on the ‘+’ sign, and select ‘Simple Payments’. Enter in the amount to collect, a note about the transaction (optional), and toggle the tax collection on or off, as needed. Then use the card reader to collect payment.</p>



<p>To use <strong>Simple Payments for a quick transaction</strong>, navigate to the Orders tab in the Mobile App, click on the ‘+’ sign, and select ‘Simple Payments’. Enter in the amount to collect, a note about the transaction (optional), and toggle the tax collection on or off, as needed. Then use the card reader to collect payment.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="nfc-transaction-status"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#nfc-transaction-status">NFC Transaction Status<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>NFC (Near Field Communication) is a feature that enables short-range communication between compatible devices. In the case of In-Person Payments, it’s the communication between a customer’s NFC-enabled bank card and the card reader. </p>



<p>When payment is made via this method, success or failure is signaled via audible beep(s). All 4 LED lights will show as green on the reader when reading the card information.&nbsp; When the card read is successful, they will be accompanied by 1 beep. If there are 2 beeps, there has been an error and you should retry.</p>
