<p>It is not possible to use an existing Stripe account with WooCommerce Payments. </p>



<p>Although WooCommerce Payments is <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/powered-by-stripe/">built in partnership with Stripe</a>, our plugin uses a special kind of Stripe account (called a Stripe Express account). The Express account is created when you sign up for WooCommerce Payments.</p>



<p>If you are logged into Stripe.com with an existing Stripe account when you start the WooCommerce Payments signup process, your new Express account can be <em>linked</em> with an existing Stripe account. However, they will still be two separate accounts that do not share or sync data in any way.</p>



<p>It is not possible to link the WooCommerce Payments Express account with a regular Stripe account after onboarding.</p>



<p>If you must use an existing Stripe account on your WooCommerce store, please use the free <a href="https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-and-stripe/">Stripe extension</a>. If you are unsure whether to use WooCommerce Payments or the Stripe extension, consult our <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-vs-stripe-plugin-comparison/">comparison page</a>.</p>
