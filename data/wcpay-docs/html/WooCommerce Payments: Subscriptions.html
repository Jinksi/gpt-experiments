			<div class="entry">
				
<p>WooCommerce Payments <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/subscriptions/">supports selling subscription products</a>. Unlike other&nbsp;payment gateways, which require the use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/">Subscriptions&nbsp;extension</a>, WooCommerce Payments offers&nbsp;built-in&nbsp;subscriptions functionality that can be used without any other plugin.</p>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/">Our overview document</a> explains the requirements you must meet to use subscriptions, how to set up subscription products, and other such basics.</p>

<p>The standalone <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/">Subscriptions extension</a> is one of our most popular extensions. If youâ€™re wondering how it compares to the subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments, we have <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/comparison/">a document that outlines the differences</a>. </p>



<p>Also note that many extensions which are intended to work with Subscriptions <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/subscriptions/compatibility/">will also work</a> with the WooCommerce Payments subscriptions functionality.</p>



<p>If you are already using one subscription offering and want to migrate to the other option, please refer to our guides here:</p>
