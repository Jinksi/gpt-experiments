			<div class="entry">
				
<p>Because WooCommerce Payments is built <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/">in partnership with Stripe</a>, it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether to use WooCommerce Payments or <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/stripe/">the Stripe plugin itself</a>. In order to help you choose between the two, we’ve highlighted some important differences here.</p>



<p>It’s also possible to use both gateways at the same time, although this does <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/can-i-use-woocommerce-payments-and-the-stripe-plugin-at-the-same-time/">cause a few issues</a> to be aware of.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="dashboard-integration"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#dashboard-integration">WordPress dashboard integration<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>WooCommerce Payments is designed to integrate closely with your WordPress website. It does this by displaying all your transaction data, deposit records, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-stripe-capital/">Capital loan</a> details, and other information right within your site’s dashboard. This means you don’t need to leave your site’s admin interface to perform common business tasks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2047" height="916" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18734000810276" srcset="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png 2047w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png?resize=620,277 620w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png?resize=768,344 768w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png?resize=650,291 650w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png?resize=1536,687 1536w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png?resize=300,134 300w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png?resize=958,429 958w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bank account deposits inside the WordPress dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<p>The regular Stripe plugin is not so closely integrated with the WordPress dashboard. As a result, some tasks will require you to log into Stripe’s dashboard to complete them. (For example, reconciling your payments or challenging disputes.)</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="subscriptions"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#subscriptions">Built-in subscriptions features<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>With WooCommerce Payments, eligible merchants can charge for <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/">subscription products</a> with no additional plugins. This lets you sell products that take regularly recurring payments from your customers, such a monthly magazine or a quarterly subscription box.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1562" height="1080" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18734000810279" srcset="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png 1562w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png?resize=620,429 620w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png?resize=768,531 768w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png?resize=650,449 650w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png?resize=1536,1062 1536w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png?resize=300,207 300w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png?resize=958,662 958w" sizes="(max-width: 1562px) 100vw, 1562px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An example subscription product made with WooCommerce Payments</figcaption></figure>



<p>The regular Stripe plugin does not have this feature built-in. To be able to sell subscription products with the Stripe plugin, you would need <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/">our premium Subscriptions extension</a>.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="multiple-currencies"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#multiple-currencies">Accepting multiple currencies<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>If you sell your products to customers in multiple countries, you can use the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/multi-currency-setup/">multi-currency features</a> in WooCommerce Payments to receive payments in various currencies. It can also give your customers a choice of currencies to pay in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1964" height="1146" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18734000810280" srcset="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png 1964w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png?resize=620,362 620w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png?resize=768,448 768w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png?resize=650,379 650w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png?resize=1536,896 1536w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png?resize=958,559 958w" sizes="(max-width: 1964px) 100vw, 1964px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Configuring which currencies to sell your products in</figcaption></figure>



<p>The regular Stripe plugin does not have this built-in. Instead, you would need to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/search/?q=currency&amp;collections=product">install a second plugin</a> to enable multi-currency support.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="in-person-payments"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#in-person-payments">In-person payments for Canada<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>WooCommerce Payments offers merchants in the U.S. and Canada the option to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/getting-started-with-in-person-payments-with-woocommerce-payments/">accept in-person payments</a> using a card reader device.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-18734000822619" width="329" height="373" srcset="https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg 1125w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg?resize=620,703 620w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg?resize=768,870 768w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg?resize=650,737 650w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg?resize=300,340 300w, https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg?resize=958,1086 958w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taking payment for an in-person order</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Stripe plugin only offers <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/stripe/accept-in-person-payments-with-stripe/">in-person payments</a> for U.S. merchants.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="setup-and-api-keys"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#setup-and-api-keys">Initial setup and API keys<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>WooCommerce Payments creates a special kind of Stripe account for you during the signup process, called a Stripe Express account. This account is linked directly to your site, without you having to copy and paste any API keys. This makes the initial setup process less complex as compared to the Stripe plugin.</p>



<p>However, because WooCommerce Payments does not make the Stripe API keys available (even after setup is complete), it may not be suitable for certain merchants. For example, if you need to integrate with a third-party accounting service which requests the Stripe API keys, the Stripe plugin would be a better fit. This is because it connects to regular Stripe accounts, which do make their API keys available to you.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="country-availability"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#country-availability">Country availability<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>The regular Stripe plugin supports businesses based in more countries than WooCommerce Payments at this time. You can tell us where you’d like to see WooCommerce Payments next by filling out <a href="https://woocommerce.com/payments/#request-invite">this form</a>.</p>

<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="instant-deposit-requirements"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#instant-deposit-requirements">Instant deposit requirements<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>Instant deposits give eligible merchant a way to request an instant deposit of some or all of their account balance. To help prevent abuse of this feature, both WooCommerce Payments and Stripe themselves have requirements that must be met before merchants can enable instant deposits.</p>



<p>WooCommerce Payments has slightly <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/instant-deposits/#section-1">different requirements</a> before merchants can enable Instant Deposits. Stripe’s <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/instant-payouts-eligibility">Instant Payouts requirements</a> are the relevant ones if you use the Stripe plugin. Here’s a comparison chart:</p>

<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="advanced-stripe-features"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#advanced-stripe-features">Advanced Stripe features<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>Though WooCommerce Payments does take advantage of some of Stripe’s features, such as <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/does-woocommerce-payments-use-stripe-radar/">Radar</a> for fraud protection or <a href="https://stripe.com/billing">Billing</a> for recurring subscriptions, the overall goal is to simplify the process of taking payments for your business.</p>



<p>If your business requires some of the more advanced features Stripe offers, you may wish to use the Stripe plugin in combination with a regular Stripe account.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h3 id="multiple-businesses-or-sites"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#multiple-businesses-or-sites">Multiple businesses or websites<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h3></header>



<p>WooCommerce Payments works by connecting to a single <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/">Stripe Express account</a> and pulling all your transaction data and deposit information in the WordPress dashboard. This is very convenient and perfectly functional for most merchants.</p>



<p>However, if you need to take payments from multiple WooCommerce websites, but view reporting for those sites all in a single place, using the standalone Stripe plugin may be better.</p>
