<p>WooCommerce Payments is built in partnership with <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. This document provides more information and an overview of how we work together. </p>



<p>When you sign up for WooCommerce Payments, you verify your personal and business information with Stripe. This creates a Stripe Express account that is connected to the WooCommerce Payments service. The Express account is what’s used in the background for managing your business account information and activity with WooCommerce Payments.</p>

<p>Our Happiness Engineers are here to help you set up and manage your store and usage of WooCommerce Payments. The support team will assist you with all payment processing issues and other operational questions, such as why one of your customer’s payments failed, or why a deposit has not been received.</p>



<p>Although our support staff should always be your initial contact, we may sometimes refer you to <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/contact-stripe-support">Stripe support</a> when needed.</p>

<p><a id="dashboard"></a>With WooCommerce Payments, you interact with your store’s transactions via a dashboard integrated into your WordPress administration area. WooCommerce Payments accounts do not have access to the Stripe Dashboard provided to standard Stripe accounts.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="updating-account-information"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#updating-account-information">Updating account information<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Updating certain account information can only be done <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/access-stripe-account/">in the Stripe Express dashboard</a>. The following account information can be updated there:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name</li>



<li>Address</li>



<li>Contact information</li>



<li>Business information</li>



<li>Ownership details</li>



<li>Bank account</li>



<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although WooCommerce Payments built in partnership with Stripe, it is <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/existing-stripe-account/">not possible to connect an existing Stripe account</a> to WooCommerce Payments. If you must use a pre-existing, regular Stripe account on your WooCommerce store, you should install our free <a href="https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-and-stripe/">Stripe extension</a> to accomplish that. You can even <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/can-i-use-woocommerce-payments-and-the-stripe-plugin-at-the-same-time/">use both WooCommerce Payments and the Stripe extension</a> together.</p>



<header class="toc-header"><h2 id="stripe-agreement-updates"><a class="wccom-docs-anchor-links" href="#stripe-agreement-updates">Stripe agreement updates<span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-links"></span></a> </h2></header>



<p>Occasionally, Stripe may update their <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/connect-account">Connected Account Agreement</a>, which contains the terms you agreed to during the WooCommerce Payments signup process. If you wish to opt out of these terms, please <a href="https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/">contact support</a> and request that we unlink your WooCommerce Payments account from your site. </p>



<p>Keep in mind that opting out in this way means that you will no longer be able to use WooCommerce Payments <strong>at all</strong>. Although your remaining account balance will still be deposited as per <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/deposit-schedule/">your usual schedule</a>, you will not be able to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Have customers place new orders via WooCommerce Payments </li>



<li>Refund any orders placed with WooCommerce Payments </li>



<li>Challenge disputes filed for WooCommerce Payments orders</li>



<li>Log into the WooCommerce Payments Stripe Express account</li>



<li>etc.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, opting out will effectively end your usage of WooCommerce Payments, after which you can delete the plugin from your site.</p>
