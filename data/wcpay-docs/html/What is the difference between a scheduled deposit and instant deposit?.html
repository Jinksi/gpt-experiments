			<div class="entry">
				
<p>With WooCommerce Payments, after a customer makes a purchase through your store, the funds from that transaction are placed into a pending balance on your account.</p>



<p>Normally, the funds in your account are subject to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/deposit-schedule/#section-2">a standard pending period</a>, after which they are made available for the next upcoming deposit. You can <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/change-deposit-schedule/">change the deposit schedule</a> if you wish, between daily, weekly, and monthly. Scheduled deposits such as these can take a day or more to arrive in your bank account. There are no extra fees for these regular deposits.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/instant-deposits/">Instant Deposits</a>, you can request some or all of your available balance to be deposited immediately, up to a daily maximum. These deposits can only be made to debit cards, and are subject to <a href="https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/instant-deposits/">an additional fee</a>, but the funds will arrive within minutes. Please see the linked documentation on Instant Deposits for more information.</p>
