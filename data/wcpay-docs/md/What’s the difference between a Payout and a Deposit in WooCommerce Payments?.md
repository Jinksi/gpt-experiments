# What’s the difference between a Payout and a Deposit in WooCommerce Payments?

After you receive a payment via WooCommerce Payments, the amount of that payment (minus transaction fees) will be added to your account balance. This balance is regularly transferred to your bank account or debit card. These transfers are referred to as “deposits.”

You may be familiar with the term “payouts” from other payment gateways. Payouts are the same as deposits with WooCommerce Payments. The naming difference is based on feedback from WooCommerce merchants who preferred “deposits.”
