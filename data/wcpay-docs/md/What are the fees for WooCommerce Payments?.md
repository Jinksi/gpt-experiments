# What are the fees for WooCommerce Payments?

WooCommerce Payments uses a “pay-as-you-go” pricing model. In other words, there are no setup fees, monthly fees, or other hidden charges. Instead, our fees are deducted directly from each payment made via WooCommerce Payments.

The exact fees we charge differ based on various factors, such as the country your business is located in, the country your customer is located in, the currency with which the customer paid, the payment method chosen by the customer, and so on. See our full list of fees below for a detailed breakdown.

Please note that [fees are not refunded](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees-refund/) when you issue refunds to your customers.
