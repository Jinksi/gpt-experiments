# Instant Deposits with WooCommerce Payments

WooCommerce Payments provides a way for eligible accounts to request an instant deposit of some or all of the account balance. After requesting an instant deposit, the money will arrive within minutes instead of days. Instant deposits can also be initiated any time.

Instant deposits are subject to additional fees. Please see [our fees page](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/fees/) for details.

## [Eligibility requirements](#eligibility-requirements)

To be eligible to request an instant deposit, your account must meet the following criteria:

*   Based in the U.S.
*   More than 90 days old.
*   Processed more than $1,000 during the last 90 days.
*   Under 1% of transactions disputed in the last 90 days.
*   Use [a debit card to receive deposits](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/change-deposit-account-info/) from your account.

Finally, please note that participation in optional WooCommerce Payments features, such as Instant Deposits, is at the sole discretion of the WooCommerce team. Your accountâ€™s eligibility may differ to the above requirements.

## [Deposit limits](#deposit-limits)

Unlike scheduled deposits, there is both a minimum and maximum deposit amount that can be processed through an instant deposit. The minimum instant deposit amount is $50 per deposit. The maximum is $1000 per day. Only 1 instant deposits can be requested a day.

If the minimum limit has not been reached, or if the maximum limit has been exceeded, the button will be disabled.

## [Add a debit card as payout method](#add-debit-card)

To request an instant deposit, you must have a debit card added to your account. To add a debit card, follow the instructions [on this page](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/change-deposit-account/) for changing your deposit method, being sure to use a debit card instead of a bank account.
