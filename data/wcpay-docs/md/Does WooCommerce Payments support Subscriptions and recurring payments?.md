# Does WooCommerce Payments support Subscriptions and recurring payments?

Unlike other [payment gateways](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/), which require the use of the [Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), WooCommerce Payments supports both the Subscriptions extension and offers _built-in_ subscriptions functionality that can be used _without_ the Subscriptions extension.

As a result, when using WooCommerce Payments, you have a choice between two different ways to sell subscriptions:

*   The built-in subscription functionality
*   The WooCommerce Subscriptions extension

To learn more about each one and which might be best for your store, please consult [our comparison guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions-basics/comparison/). To learn how to use the built-in subscriptions functions of WooCommerce Payments, refer to [the subscriptions section](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/built-in-subscriptions/) of our documentation.

## [Compatibility with additional payment methods](#additional-payment-methods)

WooCommerce Payments can display [additional payment methods](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/additional-payment-methods/) based on the customerâ€™s location. Some of these are also compatible with the [Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).

SEPA Direct Debit1

iDEAL

While iDeal, Bancontact, and Sofort support recurring payments via SEPA Direct Debit1, SEPA is the option shown to customers at checkout. Przelewy24 and giropay do not support recurring payments with the Subscriptions extension.

If you are using the [built-in subscriptions functionality](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/built-in-subscriptions/) of WooCommerce Payments, only card payments are supported.

1 SEPA is currently available only in private beta.
