# WooCommerce Payments: Stripe Capital

WooCommerce has partnered with Stripe to offer eligible businesses access to fast and flexible financing through the [Stripe Capital program](https://stripe.com/capital). Through this partnership, WooCommerce and Stripe Capital may offer you a small business loan originated by Celtic Bank.

WooCommerce and Stripe work jointly to identify and contact merchants using WooCommerce Payments who may qualify, so keep watch for an email about your eligibility.

Our [guide to Stripe Capital](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-stripe-capital/) offers a more in-depth explanation of this program, and our [Stripe Capital FAQ](https://woocommerce.com/document/stripe-capital-faq/) can answer many common questions you may have.
