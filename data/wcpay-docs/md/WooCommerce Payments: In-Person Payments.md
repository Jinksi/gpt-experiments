# WooCommerce Payments: In-Person Payments

With WooCommerce Payments’ In-Person Payments feature, your customers can pay via tap, swipe, chip card, or mobile wallet payments, all using our mobile app and a simple card reader or a device that supports Tap to Pay on iPhone.

In-Person Payments is available to qualified U.S. and Canadian merchants using iPhone, iPad, or Android devices for non-subscription products. Support for subscriptions and other countries is coming soon!

With an iPhone XS or newer, you can use [Tap to Pay on iPhone](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/in-person-payments/woocommerce-in-person-payments-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-quick-start-guide/) to take contactless payments without additional hardware.

### [M2 Card Reader](#m2-card-reader)

Not all payments can be accepted using Tap to Pay on iPhone, for example:

*   Swipe or chip-only cards
*   Payments on an Android device, iPad, or older iPhone

To accept these payments, you will need a card reader. For U.S. merchants, we have the [M2](https://href.li/?https://woocommerce.com/products/m2-card-reader/).
