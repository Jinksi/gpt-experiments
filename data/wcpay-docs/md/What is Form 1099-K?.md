# What is Form 1099-K?

### [What is the 2022 tax process?](#2022-tax-process)

In 2022, there were a few changes to the process for issuing 1099-Ks. The process is outlined below. We have built WooCommerce Payments [in partnership with Stripe](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/), thus expect some communication from Stripe with regard to your 1099-K.  

### [Updates for the 2022 tax year](#updates-for-2022)

For the 2022 tax year, the U.S. threshold for issuing 1099-K’s has been reduced from $20,000 to $600. As such, if you have processed over $600 in payments in 2022, you will receive a 1099-K tax form.

**UPDATE:** On December 23rd, the [IRS announced a delay](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-delay-for-implementation-of-600-reporting-threshold-for-third-party-payment-platforms-forms-1099-k) to the lowering of the 1099-K reporting threshold until next tax year. This means that, for tax year 2022, the 1099-K filing threshold will remain the same as for tax year 2021: $20,000 or more in payments from over 200 transactions. 1099-K forms sent to you via the Stripe Express dashboard have already been updated in consideration of the new threshold. If you are below the threshold, a 1099-K will not be available for you.

**Verification Phase**: On or around November 28, 2022, merchants who are eligible to receive a 1099-K will be sent a verification email from WooCommerce Payments and Stripe. This email will have a link for you to confirm your identity, tax information, as well as provide you with the option to consent to **e-delivery** (meaning you will receive your 1099-K form electronically if you consent). _We recommend adding express@stripe.com to your address book so the email isn’t marked as spam._

Should you need to update your information, you can do so via the link in the email. If you have any questions or need help, please reach out to [WooCommerce support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/).

If you are unable to access the link, or you do not consent to e-delivery, you will still be mailed a physical 1099-K form.

**eDelivery**: Starting on or around January 3, 2023 WooCommerce Payments in partnership with Stripe will send you your 1099-K’s.Your 1099 tax form will be made available to view and download in [Stripe Express.](http://express.stripe.com) You’ll need this form to file your 2022 taxes. 

In the event that you did not opt in to eDelivery, you will be mailed a physical copy of your 1099-K. Please note that due to delivery delays with the postal service, we cannot confirm exactly when you will receive it. If you have any questions, please reach out to [WooCommerce support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) and we will be happy to help. 

### [What is Form 1099-K?](#what-is-form-1099k)

Form 1099-K is an information filing required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States. WooCommerce Payments is required to issue a 1099-K to U.S. persons with payments processed that exceed the following thresholds:

*   For returns for the calendar year 2022:
    *   Gross payments that exceed $600 
*   For returns for calendar years prior to 2022:
    *   Gross payments that exceed $20,000, and…
    *   More than 200 such transactions
*   For returns for calendar years after 2021:
    *   Gross payments for goods or services that exceed $600, and…
    *   Any number of transactions

Additional information can be found [on the IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k).

We recommend consulting with your tax advisor for additional information and to understand which threshold applies in your state.

### [Why did I receive a Form 1099-K?](#why-did-i-receive-a-1099k)

We issue a 1099-K if a merchant meets either the federal filing threshold or a lower threshold applicable in their state.

### [What if I didn’t meet the IRS threshold, but still got a form?](#didnt-meet-irs-threshold)

A 1099-K may be issued for a few reasons, even if the IRS threshold is not met:

*   Many states have a lower threshold than the federal government. A form will be filed if either the state or federal threshold is met.
*   There are multiple accounts with the same tax identification number (TIN). Accounts using the same TIN are combined to determine if a filing is required. Even if all accounts are _individually_ below the filing threshold, each account under the same TIN will receive a 1099-K if the _combined_ total transaction and payment volumes exceed the threshold.
    *   A TIN, or Tax Identification Number is the number used for business reporting by the IRS. This may be the owner’s Social Security Number (SSN), or an Employer Identification Number (EIN), which you can get via the IRS website. [More information here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employer-id-numbers).

### [What does the amount on Form 1099-K include?](#what-does-1099k-include)

A 1099-K includes gross sales, without regard to refunds, fees, chargebacks, or other reductions.

### [Why doesn’t the amount reported match the payouts I’ve received?](#doesnt-match-payouts-received)

Because a 1099-K is required to include gross sales, it will include amounts that are not deposited into your bank account, such as:

*   Refunds
*   Fees
*   Disputed charges
*   Funds reserved
*   Transactions that haven’t been deposited yet
