# Can I migrate my information between accounts?

Creating a new WooCommerce Payments account and switching to it should be avoided in almost all circumstances. This is because itâ€™s not possible to migrate all of your data from one account to another.

Even if you did switch, doing so would have severe consequences, e.g. transactions that took place on the old account will no longer be manageable via your WooCommerce dashboard, so you would be unable to refund them or respond to disputes.

If you need to change some information in your WooCommerce Payments account, there are ways to do that:

*   [How to update your name or business name](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/name-changes/)
*   [How to change your bank account information](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/change-deposit-account/)
*   [How to update your contact details](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/update-my-contact-details-wc-payments/)

There is only one scenario in which migrating to a new WooCommerce Payments account is required: **if your business moves from one country to another**. If this applies to you, please [contact our support staff](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) for help.
