# WooCommerce Payments: Subscriptions

WooCommerce Payments [supports selling subscription products](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/subscriptions/). Unlike other payment gateways, which require the use of the [Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), WooCommerce Payments offers built-in subscriptions functionality that can be used without any other plugin.

[Our overview document](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/) explains the requirements you must meet to use subscriptions, how to set up subscription products, and other such basics.

## [Comparison to the Subscriptions extension](#comparison-to-subscriptions)

The standalone [Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) is one of our most popular extensions. If you’re wondering how it compares to the subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments, we have [a document that outlines the differences](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/comparison/).

Also note that many extensions which are intended to work with Subscriptions [will also work](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/subscriptions/compatibility/) with the WooCommerce Payments subscriptions functionality.
