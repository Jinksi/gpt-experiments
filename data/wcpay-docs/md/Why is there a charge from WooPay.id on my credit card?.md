# Why is there a charge from WooPay.id on my credit card?

If you see a `WooPay.id` entry on your credit card statement, it does not mean you made a purchase on WooCommerce.com. Instead, it means that you purchased from a business that accepts payments via [WooCommerce Payments](https://woocommerce.com/payments/).

Businesses use WooCommerce Payments to sell many different types of products, including:

*   Physical products like clothing, household goods, or food.
*   Services like personal training or business coaching.
*   Virtual products like music, eBooks, or software.

If you do not recognize the transaction associated with the `WooPay.id` entry on your statement, we can help you identify the charge. **Please do not dispute the charge as the dispute can negatively impact small businesses you have transacted with!**

## [Identifying the transaction](#identifying-the-transaction)

To identify the charge, check your email for receipts or invoices around the date and time the charge was processed. Please also check in your Spam and Trash folders.

To help you search, the default subject line of email receipts sent by WooCommerce ends with the phrase “order has been received”. In the body of the email, it will say “thank you for your order”. Try searching your inbox for one or both of these phrases.

If you don’t find any emails, it is possible that the transaction is still legitimate and that the business changed the content of the email or that there was an error sending the email.

## [Contact us](#contact-us)

If you are unable to recall the purchase or find an email about the transaction, you can [contact the WooCommerce support team](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/?select=5278104) to request that we find the website which placed the charge.

When you request assistance, please provide:

*   Date and time of the transaction
*   Amount of the transaction
*   Full name on your card
*   Post/ZIP code on your card
*   Last 4 digits of your card

Once the charge has been identified, you will need to be able to email us from the same email address used to place the order before we will disclose the business’ website. This protects the privacy of customers making purchases via WooCommerce Payments.
