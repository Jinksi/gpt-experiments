# Can I change the title and description of the payment gateway shown during checkout?

Yes, both the title (“Credit card / debit card”) and description (“Enter your card details”) can be changed with many free translation plugins, such as [Say What](https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/) or [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/). Almost any string can be changed by using the [text domain](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#text-domains) of `woocommerce-payments`.

As an example, here’s how to change the description with Say What:

*   ![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-08-31-at-20.09.59-UTC@2x.png)
