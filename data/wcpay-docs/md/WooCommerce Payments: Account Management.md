# WooCommerce Payments: Account Management

WooCommerce Payments is [built in partnership with Stripe](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/), our payments processor. This means that, during the signup process for WooCommerce Payments, a special kind of Stripe account will be created for you, called a Stripe Express account.

The documentation pages below explain how to access this account, how to change information in the account, and answer other questions you might have.

**NOTE:** A Stripe Express account is different from a regular Stripe account, which is what you’d get if you simply visited Stripe.com and signed up there. See the [Regular Stripe accounts](#regular-stripe-accounts) section for details on how WooCommerce Payments does and does not interact with regular Stripe accounts.

## [Accessing your account](#section-1)

Although WooCommerce Payments is designed to integrate pretty closely with your existing WordPress dashboard, sometimes you might need to [access your Stripe Express account](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/access-stripe-account/) directly. (For example, to update your bank information or your tax ID number.) Please see the linked guide for instructions on how to access the Stripe Express account.

## [Updating your information](#section-2)

There are various bits of information that can only be updated directly in your Stripe Express account. Some common examples are:

*   [How do I update my contact details such as email address or phone number?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/update-my-contact-details-wc-payments/)
*   [How do I update my business name or DBA with WooCommerce Payments?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/name-changes/)
*   [How do I update my tax ID number with WooCommerce Payments?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/tax-id-changes/)
*   [How do I change my business type, e.g. from an individual to an LLC?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/change-business-type/)
*   [How do I transfer a site that uses WooCommerce Payments to a new owner?](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/transfer-site-to-new-owner/)

## [Switching and deleting accounts](#section-3)

The following scenarios are rare, but you may run into them when operating multiple sites or shutting down a website for a business that’s no longer operating.

*   [Can one WooCommerce Payments account be used with multiple websites?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/can-one-woocommerce-payments-account-be-used-with-multiple-websites/)
*   [Can I migrate my information between two different accounts?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/can-i-migrate-my-information-between-accounts/)
*   [How do I delete or stop using my WooCommerce Payments account?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/how-do-i-delete-my-woocommerce-payments-account/)
*   [How do I transfer a site that uses WooCommerce Payments to a new owner?](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/transfer-site-to-new-owner/)

## [Regular Stripe accounts](#regular-stripe-accounts)

It is not possible to use an existing Stripe account with WooCommerce Payments. We have a few more details in [this FAQ entry](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/existing-stripe-account/), but the basic answer remains the same. You can [use the same email address](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/how-do-i-sign-up-for-stripe-using-the-same-email-as-my-woocommerce-payments-account/) for both accounts, however.

If you currently use our Stripe extension with a regular Stripe account and would like to switch to WooCommerce Payments, [our guide to switching](https://woocommerce.com/document/migrating-to-woocommerce-payments-from-stripe/) is what you’re looking for. If you’re unsure about which is best, [our comparison guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/compatibility/woocommerce-payments-vs-stripe-plugin-comparison/) may be of assistance.
