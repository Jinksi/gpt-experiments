# Can one WooCommerce Payments account be used with multiple websites?

No, WooCommerce Payments accounts can only be connected to one site at a time. You can, however, have multiple accounts, each connected to a different site.

Refer to [How do I delete unwanted or duplicate accounts?](https://woocommerce.com/document/how-do-i-remove-duplicate-accounts/) and [Can I migrate information between accounts?](https://woocommerce.com/document/can-i-migrate-my-information-between-accounts/) for information relevant to those scenarios.
