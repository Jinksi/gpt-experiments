# Can I sell alcohol with WooCommerce Payments?

If your business sells alcohol to customers in Canada or the U.S., you must [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) for approval. We try to review all requests for approval within 7 business days, and we reserve the right to approve or reject merchants at our discretion.

For merchants in other countries, _our_ approval is not required, but you must ensure that _Stripe themselves_ do not [prohibit alcohol sales in your region](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses). If alcohol sales in your region are permitted by Stripe, you are clear to sell alcohol using WooCommerce Payments.
