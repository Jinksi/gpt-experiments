# Does WooCommerce Payments support 3D Secure?

Yes, WooCommerce Payments supports 3D Secure (also known as “3DS” or “SCA”) on both the checkout page and the Pay For Order page.

To test the checkout flow on your store with the additional 3D Secure verification step, you can use a [3D Secure test card](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/#section-7) while WooCommerce Payments is in [test mode](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/).
