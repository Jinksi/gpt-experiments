# Can I sell CBD and Other Hemp-Derived Products with WooCommerce Payments?

Due to restrictions from our payments processor and their service providers, [some businesses and product types](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/restricted-products/) are not allowed to transact using WooCommerce Payments. This restriction includes CBD products.

We are working with our payments partners to make it possible to sell CBD via WooCommerce Payments. However, for now, merchants selling CBD must use [Square](https://woocommerce.com/products/square/) or [Viva Wallet](https://woocommerce.com/products/viva-wallet-for-woocommerce/).
