# How do I update my business name or DBA with WooCommerce Payments?

If you created your WooCommerce Payments account for a company, you can update the name your business operates under by adding a “Doing business as” (DBA) name.

The process of changing your DBA name is exactly the same as the process for [updating your tax ID](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/tax-id-changes/), so you can use those instructions to update your DBA as well.

**NOTE:** The “Doing business as” name is only available on accounts created as a company entity. It is not available on individual accounts.
