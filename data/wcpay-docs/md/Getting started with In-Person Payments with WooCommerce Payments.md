# Getting started with In-Person Payments with WooCommerce Payments

With the launch of **WooCommerce In-Person Payments**, we’re excited to have you join us on this journey as we bring tap, swipe, chip card, and mobile wallet payments to your store!

**WooCommerce In-Person Payments** is available to qualified U.S. and Canadian merchants using iPhone, iPad, or Android devices for non-subscription-based products. Support for subscriptions and other countries is coming soon.

## [Introducing Your Card Reader](#meet-your-card-reader)

Both the M2 reader and the WisePad 3 ship with a partial charge. We recommend that it be charged fully before the first use. To charge your reader, use the included USB-C cable to connect the reader to any USB charger. A full charge will take a few hours.

**NOTE:** Do **not** pair the card reader via your phone or tablet’s built-in settings. The [WooCommerce mobile app](https://woocommerce.com/mobile/) will communicate with the reader automatically.

## [Requirements](#meet-your-card-reader)

All In-Person Payments require the following:

*   A connection to the Internet via WiFi or cellular data.
*   The latest version of **[WooCommerce Payments](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-payments/)** must be active.
*   Your WooCommerce Payments account is in good standing.
*   A device running iOS 15+ or Android 5+.

If you’d like to collect In-Person Payments using **Tap to Pay on iPhone**, you will need an iPhone which meets the following requirements:

*   iPhone XS or newer.
*   iOS 16.0 or above.
*   The device must be signed in to an iCloud account.
*   The device must have a passcode set.
*   The NFC (near field communication) chip must not be disabled.

## [Getting Started: Testing Your Reader Connection](#testing-reader-connection)

First, allow your reader to fully charge. To do that, use the supplied cable to connect the USB-C on the reader to a USB charger. With a full charge, the reader should be able to process 600 to 800 contactless transactions before needing a recharge.

The next step is to connect your card reader to your mobile device for the first time. To do so, in the WooCommerce Mobile App, go to **Menu > Payments**:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8ld_zXJgOdFzoQKs14l1NTXfLRHxBncE9qSYw9lnShRPOT8NHa6j3aMpJh9O4eXhwziIdi0ggUeOP_EsOnDcoieRLmfOIT2CLTivCDxk-XyCooAMk08uG6y2Habl8btLX8A4AM_ke3Pr1O3lWhVgQKI)

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/z6c5uPfG5kWQDezqHuqVb6zwW9NLmY4rf_3hUxF7kuqG1d3AJ-hHVKYukasWc4MRzLLCTaRsBl04jJRwjX6ajA-oJQZKHzxDFVsEZCYTIvb6qrHpXsv9V5fTk6VrVpBt6SVQUO-mmB8CQfxxpttJRII)

Then, on the **In-Person Payments** screen, look for **Manage card reader** and tap on it. (Keep in mind that menu options are country-dependent. Canadian merchants may see the WisePad 3 as an option instead of the Chipper and/or M2.)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tFpJdHZNAd1zchWDcYzaZbgoWkK7ahyIZ5E4Ws-TTEimEO0tuJT8ct7BT1HFkrsZ5BoGUYnHh3v9ByBN3Eg76BiINhBPcLS63OxJ0Npd6owAye0QlnAsBEgavPF3ER5bM8CNuXhXwO3HCtM07SfoTZA)

If the **Manage card reader** item is disabled, please contact support so that we can help! To reach out to us, tap on the **Menu** tab in the app, then go to **Settings (gear icon) > Help & Support > Contact Support**.

When you see the **Connect your card reader** screen, tap on **Connect Card Reader**:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jZGOeoh13NOjCL07fGz6dJI6hQ9CyL_1xVDGdqjVD4OcCG1Y_7MsJ8oVgriRYEcPr_gwiHANN2TRuIzGAhLz5DWhLcQSOCp5f9aAx1GfDm0nVMwx_wAgaqHz1ltAhSbJc_hGUdWHIKfIYOf1JFhXXGk)

You should be prompted that **Woo Would Like to Use Bluetooth**. Tap **OK** to allow this. Scanning will begin:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6xwZnlmyUhFv5wauhlB2BFaBK8w0yM2a9u32m2U8wT-RSEHS_cl5WeyjrzGFIpLeaj0KLKiKkIWJv1leYFCViyxO5DIQksISKj4qn5htvYCTzgRvx7QMwVhuEo8xS2sEtCNSBpu_xry33my_WxIHrBo)

  
Press and briefly hold the power button on your reader to turn it on. Keep it near the mobile device.

After a few seconds, you’ll see the **Do you want to connect…** prompt with your reader’s serial number. Tap **Connect to Reader** to begin the connection process.

You should see the **Allow Woo to Use Your Location** prompt. Tap to **Allow While Using App**.

That’s it: your reader is now connected and ready to accept payments!

## [Collect Fast Payment](#section-4)

To collect a payment, navigate to the Menu tab in your WooCommerce mobile app. Tap on the:

*   **Menu**
*   **Payments** 
*   **Collect payment**
*   **Enter in the amount to collect**
*   **Add an order note (optional)**
*   **Tap on collect payment**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8ld_zXJgOdFzoQKs14l1NTXfLRHxBncE9qSYw9lnShRPOT8NHa6j3aMpJh9O4eXhwziIdi0ggUeOP_EsOnDcoieRLmfOIT2CLTivCDxk-XyCooAMk08uG6y2Habl8btLX8A4AM_ke3Pr1O3lWhVgQKI)

The app supports the following payment methods: 

*   **Cash**
*   **Card**
*   **Shareable payment link**. This link can be shared with a customer and used to pay for the order online

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6_GU6v66Fz-FFF65Gn8rApsVc5D3sAHuw_c7UYu9mZ2qLWs75mHDyhp-RBSKmTQU9Hg8U7_MAlpQYZYUC29znMDWbf0V1BUYJFXjNgZip4O0CcNJ8rumsYD9oQ5EcHIebBl8j95YV6-O2NaOR8uHdQM)

When payment will be received, an order will be automatically created.

## [Buy Online, Pay at Pickup](#section-5)

If you offer local pickup or curbside pickup options, you’ll need to decide if you want to deliver to your customers, or if they will be picking up their orders, or both. You’ll then set up **Shipping Methods** that your customers can choose during checkout.

### [Option 1: Delivery](#option-1-delivery)

**If you already have shipping set up for delivery, feel free to review or skip this section without making changes.**

First, go to **WP Admin** for your store and click **WooCommerce** > **Settings** > **Shipping**.

If you don’t already have a **Shipping Zone** that includes delivery, add a new **Shipping Zone**, and give it a **Zone name**, e.g. “North End Seattle Metro”:

In **Zone regions** pick the state you deliver to and then the specific ZIP Codes:

![A screenshot of the Shipping Zone screen showing options for Zone name, Zone regions (that can be more specific via postal codes), and Shipping Methods. ](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image10-1.png?w=550)

While on this **Shipping Zone** screen, add a **Shipping Method** for delivery using the **Flat rate** method. In this example, we called it “Seattle Metro North End Delivery.“

And if you want to support traditional shipping for these nearby customers, don’t forget to add a **Shipping Method** for that too (see **USPS** above as an example.) Remember, for customers whose shipping address falls within the shipping zone, only the shipping methods specified for that zone will be visible. 

Don’t forget to click the **Save changes** button when you are finished

### [Option 2: Local Pickup](#option-2-local-pickup)

**If you already have shipping set up for local delivery, feel free to review or skip this section without making changes.**

First, go to **WP Admin** for your store and click on **WooCommerce** > **Settings** > **Shipping**.

If you don’t already have a **Shipping Zone** that includes local pickup, add a new **Shipping Zone**, and give it a **Zone name**, e.g. “Washington State”:

In **Zone regions** pick the state that you want to offer local pickup for and then, optionally, the specific ZIP Codes (or allow any ZIP code in your state if you prefer):

While on this **Shipping Zone** screen, add a **Shipping Method** for local pickup using the **Local pickup** method. In this example, we called it “Local Pickup (Free!)”

![An additional screenshot of the Shipping Zones screen. Two Shipping Methods are shown: Pickup in store (Free), and USPS. ](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image17.png?w=550)

And if you want to support traditional shipping for these nearby customers, don’t forget to add a **Shipping Method** for that too (see **USPS** above as an example.) Remember, for customers whose shipping address falls within the shipping zone, only the shipping methods specified for that zone will be visible. 

Don’t forget to click **Save changes** when you are finished

### [Option 3: Both Delivery and Local Pickup](#option-3-delivery-and-pickup)

**If you already have shipping set up for delivery and local pickup, feel free to review or skip this section without making changes.**

First, go to **WP Admin** for your store and click on **WooCommerce** > **Settings** > **Shipping**.

If you don’t already have a **Shipping Zone** that includes delivery and local pickup, add a new **Shipping Zone**, and give it a **Zone name**, e.g. “North End Seattle Metro”:

In **Zone regions** pick the state that you want to offer local pickup for (in this example, Washington State) and then the specific ZIP Codes to which you deliver.

While on this **Shipping Zone** screen, add a **Shipping Method** for delivery using the **Flat rate** method. In this example, we called it “Seattle Metro North End Delivery.”

And then add another **Shipping Method** for local pickup using the **Local pickup** method. In this example, we called it “Local Pickup (Free!)”

And if you want to support traditional shipping for these nearby customers, don’t forget to add a **Shipping Method** for that too (see **USPS** below as an example.) Remember, for customers whose shipping address falls within the shipping zone, only the shipping methods specified for that zone will be visible. 

When you’re done it should look something like this:

![A third screenshot of the Shipping Zone screen, showing yet another Shipping method has been added, this time the Seattle Metro North End Delivery. ](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image5-1.png?w=550)

Don’t forget to click **Save changes** when you are finished

For more information on setting up **Shipping Zones** see [https://woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-shipping-zones](https://woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-shipping-zones) 

## [Next, Add a Cash on Delivery Payment Method](#add-cod-payment-method)

You’ve already got the **WooCommerce Payments** **Payment Method** setup on your store to allow your customers to enter their card information on your website to complete checkout. But for **In-Person Payments**, you’ll also need to add another payment method: **Cash on Delivery**.

Don’t worry about the word “Cash” there – we’ll fix that in the next few steps.

To do so, go to **WP Admin** for your store and click on **WooCommerce** > **Settings** > **Payments** \> **All Payment Methods**:

![Showing the Payments tab that is accessible via WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > All payment methods. ](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/payment-methods.png?w=550)

Next, enable **Cash on delivery**:

![Highlighting the Cash on delivery payment method under the Payments tab in WooCommerce Settings. ](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image12.png?w=550)

Then click on **Manage** to access the settings for Cash on delivery. We recommend changing the name to something like “Pay on Delivery” or “Pay in Person” depending on your business, e.g.:

![A detailed view of the Cash on delivery payment method. Sowing the Enable/Disable checkbox setting, and title, description, instruction, Enable for shipping methods text fields, and the Accept for virtual orders checkbox setting. ](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image10.png?w=550)

Note that you can limit **Cash on delivery** to selected **Shipping Methods** like those we set up earlier. This way your customers will only see the **Cash on delivery** **Payment Method** only if they qualify for those **Shipping Methods**. Just select those **Shipping Methods** in the **Enable for shipping methods** box (see above.)

## [Collect Payment for an Order Placed Online](#collect-order-payment)

Enter Orders and browse orders in the **Processing** state. Orders created with the **Cash on Delivery Payment Method** are initially in the **Processing** state.

Tap on an order from the list, for example:

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image8.png?w=550)

  
Scroll down to the **Payment** section and tap on the **Collect Payment** button:

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image13.png?w=550)

You will be prompted to select a payment method. Select **Card** for any type of card-present payment, using either a Bluetooth card reader, or Tap to Pay on iPhone.

Alternatively, the **Cash** option marks the order as paid and updates your inventory for a cash payment, or the **Share payment link** option will bring up the share sheet to send a link that the customer can use to check out on your website, using any payment methods you have configured for web orders.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6_GU6v66Fz-FFF65Gn8rApsVc5D3sAHuw_c7UYu9mZ2qLWs75mHDyhp-RBSKmTQU9Hg8U7_MAlpQYZYUC29znMDWbf0V1BUYJFXjNgZip4O0CcNJ8rumsYD9oQ5EcHIebBl8j95YV6-O2NaOR8uHdQM)

  
If you’re using a supported iPhone, you’ll be given the option to connect a hardware card reader or use Tap to Pay on iPhone to collect the payment.

### [Collecting Payment with M2 or WisePad 3](#section-11)

You’ll be prompted to connect your card reader if it isn’t already connected. Tap on **Connect Card Reader**, wait for the reader to be found, and then tap on **Connect to Reader** to complete the connection.

Now, you should be prompted to **Collect payment from** your customer. Have your customer insert their chip card, (or swipe their older non-chip card if your device supports it). Newer cards that support tap-and-pay can be tapped to the reader. Customers may be required to enter their PIN. The reader also supports NFC wallets for mobile devices including, for example, wallets on Apple and Google mobile devices.

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image1.png?w=511)

  
If a chip card was inserted, remove the card from the reader when prompted.

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image9.png?w=500)

Wait for the payment to be processed. This can sometimes take 10 seconds or more.

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image5.png?w=482)

On success, iPhone users should hear a sound and feel a vibration. On an iPad and Android devices, you will hear a sound.

Now, you should be prompted to print or email a receipt (or **No thanks** to doing neither). You can also print a receipt later.

### [Collecting Payment with Tap to Pay on iPhone](#section-12)

After selecting **Tap to Pay on iPhone**, if this is the first time using the feature, the app will check that your device is ready to use Tap to Pay on iPhone and display a prompt to accept the terms and conditions.

You will have the option to continue with your device’s Apple ID or another Apple ID. The Apple ID you use will be associated with a merchant account for merchant account management and fraud prevention and compliance purposes through Apple.

You can unlink your Apple ID from a merchant account by contacting Apple Support or using the instructions that are sent by email after setup.

Once that one-time setup process is complete, the built-in reader will prepare to take the payment and then display the payment screen.

The card or phone used as the payment method can be tapped on the area indicated on your device. The app will then process the payment and, once completed, adjust your inventory automatically.

Now, you should be prompted to print or email a receipt (or **No thanks** to doing neither). You can also print a receipt later.

## [Receipts](#receipt-printing)

An email receipt is sent automatically upon payment collection as long as a customer email address is set on the order. You can also send the email receipt manually after the payment. However, as an In-Person Payments merchant, you are obligated to provide your customers the option of a printed receipt for any payment.

### [Printing Receipts to a Printer Accessible via the Same WiFi Network](#receipt-printer-on-wifi)

If your mobile device has access to a WiFi Network, e.g. for curbside payments or point-of-sale type payments, you should be able to use any printer accessible via that WiFi network using AirPrint (iOS) or Mopria (Android). 

Android users should note that for some printers (including the Brother RJ-4250WB-L and many others), you may need to install additional software such as the [Brother Print Service Plugin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brother.printservice&hl=en&gl=US).

### [Printing Receipts to a Portable WiFi Direct Printer (e.g. Brother RJ-4250WB-L or similar)](#portable-wifi-printer)

WiFi Direct printers like the [Brother RJ-4250WB-L](https://brothermobilesolutions.com/products/mobile-printers/ruggedjet-series/ruggedjet-4-series/brother-ruggedjet-rj4250wbl/) have their own internal WiFi access point/hotspot that a mobile device can connect to directly for printing receipts.

If you have access to a WiFi Direct Printer like the Brother RJ-4250, ensure your mobile device has access to cellular data and then connect to the printer WiFi using your device’s WiFi settings. In the case of a RJ-4250WB, the printer will have 4250WB in its SSID and the password is 425, followed by the last five digits of the serial number, e.g. 42533007.

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image3-e1634314803167.png?w=739)

You can then accept payments (over cellular data) and print receipts (over WiFi Direct). This can be especially useful for in-person delivery at a customer’s home.

### [Why Not Both?](#print-to-both)

Some printers, like the Brother RJ-4250WB-L can be used both with a traditional WiFi network _and_ with WiFi Direct. This is great for maximizing the use of a somewhat expensive printer like the Brother RuggedJet. Android users may also be able to connect to printers, like the Brother RJ-4250WB-L, using Bluetooth as a third option.

The idea is that, when you have your printer at their place of business, it can be accessed like any other printer on their WiFi network.  But when you take the printer somewhere else, like a customer’s home or trade show, the WiFi Direct mode takes precedence.

For the Brother RJ-4250WB-L, a special Windows-based **Printer Setting Tool** is needed to set up the WiFi network SSID and password. To get this tool

*   Visit the [Brother website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=eu_ot&lang=en&prod=rj4250wbeuk)
*   Click on Windows for OS Family and then choose your OS (e.g. Windows 10 (64-bit))
*   To the right of “Software/Document Installer” click on “Click to choose” and choose your preferred language.
*   Agree to the EULA, download and run the installer
*   Connect the RJ-4250WB-L to your computer using a USB Mini-B cable. The port is near the paper opening button:

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image15.png?w=496)

*   After installation completes, launch the Printer Setting Tool, connect to your RJ-4250 over USB, and click on Communication Settings

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image6.png?w=523)

*   Switch to the Wireless LAN tab, then pick Wireless Settings. Enter (or search for) your wireless network and give its passphrase. Hit Apply to send the settings to the printer.

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image14.png?w=550)

*   Lastly, on the printer itself:
    *   Press the Menu (down arrow) button until you see WLAN
    *   Press the OK button
    *   Press the Menu (down arrow) button until you see Mode
    *   Press the OK button
    *   The Menu (down arrow) button until you see Direct/Infra
    *   Press the OK button
*   Your printer should now be able to function both on your WiFi network (Infra) and off network (Direct).

## [Viewing Transactions in WP Admin](#viewing-transactions-in-wp-admin)

Payments collected using In-Person Payments appear in your **Dashboard** just like payments collected using **WooCommerce Payments** online. You can find them in **WP Admin** under **Payments** > **Transactions**.

## [Update Your Privacy Policy](#update-privacy-policy)

Like any Payment Method, customers using **In-Person Payments** should be aware of what data is shared about them and their transactions with others. Customers using **card-present-payments** can expect to have the following personal data shared with our partner Stripe:

*   their location at the time and date of purchase
*   their email address
*   their name
*   a Stripe assigned customer ID if the buyer has prior payments for this store
*   the buyer’s address and phone number
*   the quantity, price, and description of items in the order

All data is used to support fraud detection during payment collection.

[More details on privacy and our products](https://automattic.com/privacy/). 

To manage your store’s privacy policy, go to **WP Admin** for your store and click on **Settings** > **Privacy**.

## [Powering Off Your Reader](#powering-off-your-reader)

If you want to power off the M2 or WisePad 3 to save battery life, hold down the power button for about 4 seconds.

Depending on the device, either the light will go off and stay off, or the LED will display a prompt “Power off?”, which you can confirm with the green enter button on the PIN pad.

## [Refunds](#refunds)

You can refund your customers’ In-Person Payment just as you would any other WooCommerce Payments payment. Simply follow the refund flow on their order in the app or on your site via WP Admin. When refunding orders via WP Admin, be sure to select **Refund $x.xx via WooCommerce Payments** (avoid using the **Refund $x.xx Manually** button as this button does NOT refund the customer’s money automatically through WooCommerce Payments – see [Manual Refunds](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-refunds/#manual-refunds) for more information.)

If an order was paid with Interac, the refund must be initiated from the app, and the original card used for the purchase must be presented.

[![Initiate the refund from the order view screen by tapping "Issue Refund"](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/refund-step-01-order-view.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1)](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/refund-step-01-order-view.png)
