# How do I update my contact details such as email address or phone number in Stripe?

When you sign up for WooCommerce Payments, you must verify your personal and business information with Stripe. This creates a Stripe Express account, which WooCommerce Payments uses in the background for managing your business account information and activity.

As a result, this Stripe Express account has various bits of information in it, such as details about your business as well as about the individual person who created the account. This information can be updated at a later time, if need be.

**NOTE:** Changing the email or phone number that Stripe has on file is different from changing your _customer support_ email or phone number as shown [in the Settings Guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/#customer-support). For example, if you would like to route customer support requests to another team or person, then these two bits of information may differ.
