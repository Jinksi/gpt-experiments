# Additional payment methods

By default, WooCommerce Payments accepts payments via credit and debit cards. However, if you would like to add some additional, region-specific payment methods to your checkout form, you can do so by enabling our new checkout experience.

Once you’ve enabled it, you can start collecting payments via:

*   [giropay](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-giropay/)
*   [Sofort](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-sofort-payments/)
*   [iDeal](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-ideal/)
*   [P24](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-p24/)
*   [Bancontact](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-bancontact/)
*   [EPS](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-eps/)
*   [SEPA](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-sepa-direct-debit/) (closed beta)
*   [BECS Direct Debit](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-payments-becs/) (closed beta)

The new checkout experience allows your customers to select their preferred payment method and securely checkout on your site. Only the payment methods that are relevant to your customer’s location and currency are displayed.

Checkout page for a customer from Poland. Only cards and P24 are shown.

Note that the fees charged for these methods may be different than the standard card fees. Please see [our fees page](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/fees/) for a full list of our fees.

## [Add payment methods](#add-payment-methods)

Payment methods you add in the settings will only appear at checkout if they’re relevant to your customer’s location. (For example, customers in Poland will see Przelewy24, but U.S. customers will not.) As such, you can add all the methods you want to support without cluttering your checkout form.

To add additional payment methods after you’ve enabled the new experience:

1.  Go to **Payments > Settings**.
2.  In the _Payments accepted on checkout_ section, check the boxes next to whichever payment methods you want to offer in checkout.

Payment methods can also be disabled simply by unchecking their box.

### [What if a payment method can’t be enabled?](#section-3)

Depending on your account status, certain payment methods may not be available, and you’ll be asked to [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) to enable it. When contacting our support staff, please make sure to include the name of the payment method name you want to enable.
