# WooCommerce Payments — Documents

WooCommerce Payments provides access to tax-related documents available for your site. This page includes the VAT invoices we provide for merchants from eligible countries, with new document types to be added in the future.

To access your documents, go to **Payments > Documents**. (This menu item is only available to merchants that are expected to have documents, such as those in the European Union.)

On this page, you can:

*   View the list of documents.
*   Sort the list by date.
*   Filter the list by date and type.
*   Download a specific document.

The **Payments > Documents** page with some example invoices.

## [VAT invoices](#vat-invoices)

If you’re a merchant from Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, the UK, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, or Portugal, you will receive a monthly invoice showing our fees. No action is needed from you initially, but we will require you to supply your business name, address, and VAT number (if registered) when you attempt to access these invoices.

Invoices for the previous month are generated on the 10th day of each month. You may also use the **Documents** page to view historical invoices.

### [New invoice notification](#section-2)

When a new invoice is generated, you will receive an email notification like this:

When you click on the **View Report** button you will be taken to the invoice, just as if you had clicked on the **Download** button from the **Payments > Documents** page.

If you do not want to receive these notifications every month, you can use the unsubscribe link in the email footer. Even if you unsubscribe, you will still be able to access the invoices from your site’s dashboard.

### [Providing your VAT details](#providing-vat-details)

If you have not provided us with your VAT details before downloading an invoice, you will be prompted to do so when you attempt to download one. The data submitted in this form will be applied to all of your invoices, and you will not be prompted again.

If you are not registered for a VAT number, simply click on **Continue** without checking “I’m registered for a VAT number.”

If you are registered for a VAT number, please check the “I’m registered for a VAT number” box. The VAT number field with your country’s prefix should appear. Provide your VAT number and click **Continue**. You will be notified if the provided VAT number fails validation.

After clicking on **Continue**, you should be redirected to the second step of this form.

Please fill in your business name and address and click. **Confirm**. After your details are successfully saved, you will be automatically redirected to the requested invoice.

### [Editing your VAT details](#editing-vat-details)

At this time, it is not possible to edit your VAT details after submitting them. If you need to change your VAT information, please [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) and provide us with the following:

*   Company address
*   Company name
*   Company VAT number

### [Downloading an invoice](#downloading-an-invoice)

After clicking on the **View Report** link from an email notification, or the **Download** button in the **Payments > Documents** page, a new tab will open with your invoice. A print dialog, which you can use to save the invoice as a PDF file, will be displayed automatically.

The invoice document will contain a number, a date, and the time period being reported on. The information submitted in the VAT details form will be used in the **Provided To** field.

If you have funds deposited in multiple currencies, the invoice will contain one line item for each currency. Each line item will contain the number and total amount for the transactions processed in that currency, in addition to the fees charged by WooCommerce Payments.

**NOTE:** The transaction data used in the invoice is based on the UTC timezone, which may cause some discrepancies between the transactions list and the invoice.

### [Site inaccessible](#section-6)

If your site is inaccessible for some reason (e.g. your host is down or you’ve deleted the site), you can [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) for a copy of any documents you would normally have access to.
