# Why does Stripe say that my account is linked to a business that works with Stripe?

When attempting to access the Stripe dashboard via the _Forgot Password_ feature with the email address connected to your WooCommerce Payments account, you may encounter the following error:

> This account is linked to a business that works with Stripe. To view details, sign in to their website or app directly.

While your activity with WooCommerce Payments is backed by [a Stripe Express account](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/), it is [not possible to login to Stripe.com](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/access-stripe-account/#section-1) with the email address used to create your WooCommerce Payments account.

Instead, to access the Stripe account connected to WooCommerce Payments, you need to use the [login link provided within your WooCommerce siteâ€™s dashboard](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/access-stripe-account/).
