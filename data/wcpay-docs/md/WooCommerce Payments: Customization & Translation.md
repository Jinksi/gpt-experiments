# WooCommerce Payments: Customization & Translation

Although WooCommerce Payments is intended to be a payment gateway that does not require you to fiddle with settings, there are some customizations you can make to various features.

## [Customization](#customization)

Most settings are covered in the [Startup Guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/) or the [Settings Guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/settings-guide/). However, there are a few settings covered here:

*   [Can I change the title and description shown during checkout?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/can-i-change-the-title-and-description-of-the-payment-gateway-shown-during-checkout/)
*   [Requirements and recommendations for bank statement descriptor](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/bank-statement-descriptor/)

## [Translation](#translation)

When you install or update WooCommerce Payments, WordPress will automatically look for a translation file in your language and download it if one is available. That said, we have not yet translated WooCommerce Payments into every major language.

[Our Translations document](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/translations/) explains which languages we have translations for, and how to translate WooCommerce Payments into your language if we do not yet support it.

If you wish to contribute to the translation of WooCommerce Payments, you can do so using our [GlotPress translation site](https://translate.wordpress.com/). The WooCommerce Payments project is [here](https://translate.wordpress.com/projects/woocommerce/woocommerce-payments/).
