# What is the “Things to do” checklist?

The WooCommerce Payments “Things to do” checklist helps you to manage important tasks related to your store. This checklist will appear on the **Payments > Overview** screen when there are tasks that require attention.

For example, if your store has disputed payments that are awaiting a response, a task will appear to help you resolve these disputes.
