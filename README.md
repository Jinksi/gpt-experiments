## Getting Started

Add a `.env.local` file to the root of the project with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_....
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
