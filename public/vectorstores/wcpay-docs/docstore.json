This document describes how to set up, test, and troubleshoot the Apple Pay feature in WooCommerce Payments.\n\nApple Pay is only available for [eligible devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208531) with an active Apple Wallet.\n\n## [Setup](#setup)\n\nTo enable Apple Pay:\n\n1.  Go to ****Payments** > **Settings****.\n2.  In the Express Checkouts section, check the box for **Apple Pay / Google Pay**.\n3.  At the bottom of the page, click **Save Changes**.\n\n**NOTE:** There is no way to enable only Apple Pay without [Google Pay](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/payment-methods/google-pay/). The two must be enabled together.\n\n## [Customizing](#customizing)\n\nWhen Apple Pay is enabled, the Apple Pay button can appear in three places:\n\n*   On the Checkout page\n*   On the Cart page\n*   On individual product pages\n\nYou can customize which of these locations show the Apple Pay button by going to **Payments > Settings** and then clicking the **Customize** link for Apple Pay / Google Pay in the Express Checkouts section.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-11-at-14.13.22-UTC@2x.png)\n\nOnce there, you can change where the Apple Pay button shows up, the text of the Apple Pay button itself, as well as the size and color scheme of the button.\n\n## [Purchasing](#purchasing)\n\nBy checking out with Apple Pay, customers don’t need to go through the regular checkout process and spend time filling in all of their information. Everything is handled using the Apple Pay interface, where customers can select their billing and shipping details, as well as which Apple Wallet card to use.","metadata":{"title":"Accepting Apple Pay with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/payment-methods/apple-pay/"}}],["20",{"pageContent":"Once the transaction is authorized via Touch ID or Face ID, WooCommerce Payments then processes the transaction and redirects the customer to the “Order Received” / “Thank you” page.\n\n## [Product compatibility](#product-compatibility)\n\nThe express checkouts integration in WooCommerce Payments is compatible with all of these product types:\n\n*   Simple products\n*   Variable products\n*   Subscription products\n*   Variable subscriptions\n*   Bookable products1\n*   Pre-order products\n\n1 For bookable products, the Apple Pay button cannot be shown on the product page itself.\n\n## [Testing Apple Pay](#testing-apple-pay)\n\nYou can Apple Pay by making purchases in [test mode](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/) using a real Apple ID with a real Apple Wallet card.\n\nFirst, enable Test Mode by following the guide linked above. As long as you have Test Mode enabled under **Payments > Settings**, you can complete test transactions with a real card in your Apple Pay wallet without incurring any actual charges.\n\nTo set up Apple Pay on your device, you will need a supported card from a participating card issuer. See the full [list of requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204506) for Apple Pay users for more information.\n\n## [FAQ](#faq)\n\n### [Can I authorize charges with Apple Pay and capture them later?](#faq-authorize-charges)\n\nYes. If you have checked the “Issue an authorization on checkout, and capture later” option in **Payments > Settings**, you can [manually capture authorized charges](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/#section-10) done with Apple Pay, just like other credit card transactions.\n\n### [Can I issue refunds with Apple Pay?](#faq-refunds)\n\nYes. WooCommerce Payments allows you to issue refunds for Apple Pay transactions just like normal transactions. [This section](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/#section-8) of our Startup Guide shows how to refund a payment.","metadata":{"title":"Accepting Apple Pay with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/payment-methods/apple-pay/"}}],["21",{"pageContent":"### [Can I use Apple Pay for subscription products and Pre-Orders?](#faq-subscriptions-and-preorders)\n\nYes. As long as you allow customers to create an account at checkout, and enable automatic generation of a username and password under **WooCommerce > Settings > Accounts & Privacy**, the Apple Pay button will be visible on the product page for subscription and pre-order products.\n\n### [Is Apple Pay available in my country?](#faq-countries)\n\nApple Pay is available for all [countries supported by WooCommerce Payments](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/countries/#section-1).\n\n## [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n\nBefore troubleshooting Apple Pay, ensure you have **Log Error Messages** enabled under **Payments > Settings > Advanced settings**. This lets you see any error messages from WooCommerce Payments under **WooCommerce > Status > Logs**, which could potentially be useful if you need to contact our support staff.\n\n### [Apple Pay button does not appear](#button-does-not-appear)\n\nTo ensure there isn’t a problem with your browser and device combination, try using the Apple Pay button on another website. You can try [this demo](https://stripe-payments-demo.appspot.com/), for example.\n\nIf Apple Pay does not appear there either, there is likely not an issue with WooCommerce Payments itself, bur rather something about your device or browser is not configured correctly.\n\nIf Apple Pay does appear on that demo, but not on your WooCommerce Payments store, this can happen for several reasons. To try to remedy the issue, please make sure:","metadata":{"title":"Accepting Apple Pay with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/payment-methods/apple-pay/"}}],["22",{"pageContent":"If Apple Pay does appear on that demo, but not on your WooCommerce Payments store, this can happen for several reasons.

See the section below for some background and potential fixes.\n\n### [Domain registration](#domain-registration)\n\nIn order for your store to accept Apple Pay transactions, WooCommerce Payments automatically registers your domain as a verified Apple Pay merchant. Our plugin hosts the `apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` file under your domain root, for example:\n\n`https://www.example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`\n\nPlease check if this file is available from your own domain. If it’s not available, make sure you have your [permalinks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-permalinks/) (under **Settings > Permalinks**) set to anything other than **Plain**. After you do that, trigger domain registration again per the steps below and test if the button appears afterward.\n\n**To trigger domain registration manually:**","metadata":{"title":"Accepting Apple Pay with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/payment-methods/apple-pay/"}}],["23",{"pageContent":"**To trigger domain registration manually:**\n\n1.

Check the **Apple Pay / Google Pay** box in the Express Checkouts section.\n5.  Scroll to the bottom and click **Save Changes** again.\n\nIf the button still does not show up, check the error logs under **WooCommerce > Status > Logs** and see if there are domain registration related errors.

If you do need or want to enable it, please read the entirety of this document!\n\nCard transactions occur very quickly, which is what makes them convenient. In fact, they happen so fast that many people don’t realize that there are actually _two_ events taking place: an authorization and a capture.\n\nBy default, WooCommerce Payments will perform the authorization and capture at the same time. However, by enabling the **Issue an authorization on checkout, and capture later** setting, you can prevent WooCommerce Payments from automatically capturing charges. This allows you to manually capture the charge at a later time.\n\nAlthough most merchants won’t need to use this feature, it may be helpful in certain scenarios. This document explains a bit more about how authorizations and captures work, and provides some example uses cases for which enabling the option might be a good idea.\n\n## [What is an authorization vs. a capture?](#authorize-vs-capture)\n\nAn **authorization** is the first part of the charge process, in which the payment processor connects to the bank that issued the customer’s card and determines if the customer has enough money to cover the transaction cost. During this step, the funds are “held” or reserved for payment, but not actually sent to the merchant yet.\n\nA **capture** (also known as “settlement”) occurs when the merchant instructs the payment processor to transfer some or all of the held funds from the customer’s account to their own. The customer’s bank then sends the requested amount of money. The merchant also has the option of cancelling the authorization.\n\nNotably, authorizations are temporary in nature. They must be captured within seven days or the authorization will automatically expire. If that happens, the reserved funds are freed back up in the customer’s account.","metadata":{"title":"Authorize and capture","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/authorize-and-capture/"}}],["34",{"pageContent":"## [When is manual capture helpful?](#when-is-manual-capture-helpful)\n\nManually capturing authorizations is usually used in scenarios where some payment is needed up-front, but the exact final amount is not known initially.\n\nHere’s a list of some common examples where this workflow is used:\n\n*   Gas/petrol stations where you “pay at the pump” issue an authorization before you beginning filling up your vehicle. When you’re done, and the exact amount of the charge is known to their system, they will capture that amount.\n*   Hotels have an even longer time between when the charge is authorized (usually at check-in) and when the charge is captured (usually at check-out).\n*   Equipment rental businesses may request a card so that they can issue an authorization prior to allowing their customers to take the equipment home.\n*   Craftsmen who take custom orders (for a piece of furniture, say) might decide to authorize a customer’s card ahead of time and capture a different amount later on, depending on the exact work involved in the customer’s request.\n\n## [Manual capture disadvantages](#manual-capture-disadvantages)\n\nAs you can see above, there are a few limited situations where authorizing first and capturing later are needed. However, for the vast majority of merchants using WooCommerce Payments, authorizing and capturing separately has several disadvantages:","metadata":{"title":"Authorize and capture","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/authorize-and-capture/"}}],["35",{"pageContent":"*   Authorizations are temporary: they expire after seven days. If you don’t capture them in time, the customer will need to start the purchase process all over again. You might not even notice that you did not capture the charge until after you have shipped the customer their goods!\n*   You cannot capture more than the amount originally authorized. If you initially authorize too little, you will need to cancel that authorization and have the customer repurchase.\n*   The authorize and capture workflow only supports cards. It does not support any [local payment methods](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/additional-payment-methods/), which can cause inconvenience for your customers.\n\n## [Enabling authorize and capture later](#enabling-auth-and-capture)\n\nIf, after considering the above, you wish to enable authorize first and capture later, you can do that like so:\n\n1.  Go to **Payments > Settings** in your site’s dashboard.\n2.  In the _Transactions_ section, check the box next to “Issue an authorization on checkout, and capture later.”\n3.  A popup will appear to ask if you are sure. Click **Enable**.\n4.  Scroll to the bottom and click **Save Changes**.\n\nIf you’re using our [new checkout experience](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/additional-payment-methods/) and have any local payment methods enabled, a warning will be shown stating that they cannot be used while authorize and capture is enabled.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-18-at-18.06.56-UTC@2x.png)\n\n## [Viewing authorized orders](#viewing-authorized-orders)\n\nIf an order is placed while capture later is enabled, it will be assigned the On Hold status, which you can see under **WooCommerce > Orders**.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-18-at-18.19.56-UTC@2x.png)\n\nIf you open the order itself, you’ll see a note indicating that it was authorized:","metadata":{"title":"Authorize and capture","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/authorize-and-capture/"}}],["36",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-18-at-18.19.56-UTC@2x.png)\n\nIf you open the order itself, you’ll see a note indicating that it was authorized:\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-18-at-18.21.58-UTC@2x.png)\n\nAuthorized orders will also appear under **Payments > Transactions**.

The order can still be captured once it’s been edited to have a total less than or equal to the original authorized amount.\n\n## [Cancelling authorizations](#cancelling-authorizations)\n\nIf a customer wishes to cancel their order after it’s been authorized but before it’s been captured, you can do so using steps below.\n\nAlthough authorizations expire automatically after seven days, it’s best to cancel them if you’ve confirmed that you won’t need to charge the customer.

This allows you to sell subscriptions easily, without the need to install any other extensions. There is, however, an [additional fee](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/) that is added to each subscription-related transaction, and subscriptions can only be purchased with cards.\n\nThe Subscriptions extension provides access to more advanced features, including support for [dozens of different payment gateways](https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/payment-gateways/#section-1). To use Subscriptions, you must purchase an annual license for it via WooCommerce.com. After that upfront cost, only the payment gateway fees are charged on subscription-related payments. There are no additional usage fees added by Subscriptions itself.\n\n## [Which solution is right for me?](#which-is-best)\n\nCurrently, the WooCommerce Payments subscriptions functionality is available for [U.S. accounts and card payments only](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/#preview-release).

Only credit and debit cards can be used to pay for subscriptions with WooCommerce Payments.\n*   **Required features**: WooCommerce Payments provides the essential subscription functionality for a business with a recurring revenue model. WooCommerce Subscriptions provides additional [advanced features](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/comparison/#feature-matrix) that may be required for different subscription models, such as support for subscribers [upgrading their subscription with a prorated fee](https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/switching-guide/) or [signing up without a payment method](https://woocommerce.com/document/version-2-5/#section-2).\n*   **Expected revenue**: If your business expects to process more than $20,000 of subscription-related payments in the next 12 months, the upfront cost of the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension will be more economical than using the WooCommerce Payments subscriptions functionality (due to the subscription-related transaction [fees](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/)).\n\nIn general, the subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments is best suited to stores testing out a new recurring revenue model.

engine](#billing-engine)\n\nWith WooCommerce Subscriptions, automatic recurring payments are initiated on your site, and then processed by the payment gateway. This turns your WordPress site into a recurring billing engine that is completely within your control. This is referred to as an “on-site” billing engine.\n\nAn alternative approach is to have recurring payments initiated by the payment gateway itself. After the payment is initiated, the payment gateway then notifies WooCommerce about the payment so it can record the transaction in an order and take other necessary actions. This is referred to as an “off-site” billing engine, since in this case it is the payment gateway that manages when to charge the subscriber, not the WooCommerce site itself.\n\nThe built-in subscriptions functionality in WooCommerce Payments uses **an off-site billing engine**. This makes it possible to provide a greater level of reliability when collecting recurring revenue, because your subscribers will still be charged even if your site is down for some reason.\n\n**NOTE:** If you’re using the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension with WooCommerce Payments available as a payment method, automatic recurring payments for subscriptions purchased with the Subscriptions extension active will use the **on-site** billing engine.\n\n## [Extension compatibility](#extension-compatibility)\n\nThere are [many extensions](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/merchandising/subscriptions-merchandising/) in our Marketplace that modify the behavior of the Subscriptions extension.

If you don’t change it, customers could experience payment problems after the transition date.\n\nIf you have your store currency set to something else, but accept HRK using the WooCommerce Payments [multi-currency feature](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/currencies/), we suggest removing it from the enabled currencies list before Jan 1. You can do this under **WooCommerce > Settings > Multi-currency**.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-12-12-at-15.50.11-UTC@2x.png)\n\nRemoving HRK as an enabled currency\n\n## [Refunds and disputes](#refunds-and-disputes)\n\nWooCommerce Payments will attempt to refund a transaction using the same currency as the original transaction. Thus, if you refund an HRK transaction after Jan 1, 2023, that will fail. Please [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) if this happens to you.\n\nIf you took payment for an order in HRK before Jan 1, but it’s disputed after Jan 1, the refund to the customer and the dispute fee will both be processed in EUR (assuming the dispute is lost).\n\n## [Authorize and capture](#authorize-and-capture)\n\nPayments authorized in HRK before Jan 1 may be captured until Feb 1, 2023. Funds from these captures will be settled in EUR.","metadata":{"title":"Croatian Kuna (HRK) transition to Euro (EUR)","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/currencies/croatian-kuna-to-euro-transition/"}}],["58",{"pageContent":"## [Authorize and capture](#authorize-and-capture)\n\nPayments authorized in HRK before Jan 1 may be captured until Feb 1, 2023. Funds from these captures will be settled in EUR.\n\nPayments authorized in HRK cannot be _partially_ captured after Dec 27, 2022. If you need to partially capture a charge authorized in HRK after that deadline, you should either:\n\n*   Capture the full amount of the authorization and then issue a partial refund in EUR.\n*   Cancel the authorization and create a new one in EUR using the correct amount.\n\n## [Subscriptions](#subscriptions)\n\n### [New subscriptions](#new-subscriptions)\n\nOn or before Jan 1, 2023, you should switch your store currency to EUR as well as remove HRK from the list of accepted currencies (if you use the multi-currency feature). This will prevent new subscriptions from being paid for in HRK.\n\n### [Existing subscriptions](#existing-subscriptions)\n\nAfter Jan 1, 2023, subscription renewal payments in HRK will fail. The best solution for existing subscribers who pay in HRK is for you to cancel their subscriptions, let the remaining time run out, and then have the customer purchase a new subscription in EUR.\n\n## [Account balances](#account-balances)\n\nOn Dec 27, 2022, your HRK balance (if you have one) will be converted to EUR using the official fixed rate of 7.53450 HRK to 1 EUR. Pending HRK payments will be converted to EUR as they become available for deposit. Foreign exchange fees will not be charged for this.\n\nYour bank account number (IBAN) will remain the same. However, it will now be denominated in EUR. After the transition, we’ll continue using the bank account we previously used to send HRK payouts. If you currently have both EUR and HRK bank accounts, we’ll deactivate your HRK account and use your EUR account instead.","metadata":{"title":"Croatian Kuna (HRK) transition to Euro (EUR)","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/currencies/croatian-kuna-to-euro-transition/"}}],["59",{"pageContent":"# Currencies with WooCommerce Payments\n\nWith WooCommerce Payments, you can accept payments in [over 100 different currencies](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/available-currencies/). This document explains how multi-currency transactions work, the different types of currencies that might be involved in a transaction, and how to view which currency conversions were involved with a given transaction.\n\nTo learn how to display your products in your customer’s preferred currency, manage exchange rates, and other such configuration options, refer to our [multi-currency guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/multi-currency-setup/).\n\n## [Currencies in a transaction](#currencies-in-a-transaction)\n\nA single transaction can potentially involve multiple currencies. Each one is explained below.\n\n### [Customer currency](#customer-currency)\n\nThe customer currency is the currency displayed to a customer while they’re browsing your store. It’s also the currency the customer is charged in when they pay for their order. In the payments industry, this is often referred to as the “presentment currency.”\n\nBy default, the customer currency will be the same as your store’s currency, as defined under **WooCommerce > Settings > General**. The customer currency can also be set using a multi-currency plugin, or WooCommerce Payments’ built-in multi-currency functions.\n\nAs such, a single store may have more than one customer currency used in transactions.\n\n### [Deposit currency](#deposit-currency)\n\nThe [deposit currency](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/multiple-deposit-currencies/) is the currency used to deposit funds into your bank account, and is not necessarily the same as the customer currency. For example, a store based in the UK may receive deposits in pound sterling but offer the Euro as a customer currency for payments.","metadata":{"title":"Currencies with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/"}}],["60",{"pageContent":"For some merchants, it’s possible to receive deposits in different currencies into [different bank accounts](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/multiple-deposit-currencies/). For example, the UK store mentioned above could elect to receive GBP deposits into one bank account, and EUR deposits into another account.\n\n### [Store currency](#store-currency)\n\nThe store currency is the base currency used by your site, chosen during the WooCommerce setup process. You can change it at any time under **WooCommerce > Settings > General**.\n\nWithout customization (via the use of a multi-currency plugin or other code), the customer currency will be the same as the store currency.\n\n### [Account currency](#account-currency)\n\nDuring the WooCommerce Payments signup process, you must select the country of your business entity. This country is used to determine [the fees](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/fees/) you pays for transactions. For example, accounts for U.S. businesses pay their fees in U.S. dollars, regardless of other currencies involved in the transaction.\n\n## [Tracking currencies](#tracking-currencies)\n\nThe WooCommerce Payments dashboard can be used to track the currencies involved in different transactions, including deposits, payments, and disputes. This section highlights the elements of the dashboard that provide details on a transaction’s currency.\n\n### [Transactions page](#transactions-page)\n\nThe **Payments > Transactions** page shows all WooCommerce Payments transactions, regardless of currency. The amounts, fees, and the net are all displayed in the deposit currency. Transactions with a customer currency different from the deposit currency have a tooltip to view the amount paid by the customer in the customer currency.","metadata":{"title":"Currencies with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/"}}],["61",{"pageContent":"![WooCommerce Payments transactions screenshot with multiple customer currencies.](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?w=950 \"WooCommerce Payments transactions screen with multiple currencies\")\n\n### [Transaction details page](#transaction-details-page)\n\nThe transaction details page displays the transaction in the customer’s currency at the top of the overview. Underneath that amount, the amount converted to the deposit currency is displayed, along with the fees and net amounts deposited for the charge.\n\nThe timeline view provides details on the exchange rate used when converting the customer currency to the deposit currency. The [fee for currency conversion](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/) is included in the exchange rate as an additional amount on top of the mid-market rate, rather than becoming part of the separate transaction fees charged on the transaction. \n\n![WooCommerce Payments transaction details screenshot with customer currency that differs to deposit currency.](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-2.png?w=950 \"WooCommerce Payments multi-currency transaction details screen\")\n\n### [Deposit details page](#deposit-details-page)\n\nThe deposit details page shows both the amount transferred to your bank account as well as all of the individual transactions associated with that particular deposit. The amounts displayed on this page are in your deposit currency.\n\nFor transactions with a customer currency different from the deposit currency, a tooltip is displayed to view the amount paid by the customer in the customer currency.\n\n![WooCommerce Payments deposit details screenshot with customer currency that differs to deposit currency.](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-3.png?w=950 \"WooCommerce Payments multi-currency deposit details screen\")","metadata":{"title":"Currencies with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/"}}],["62",{"pageContent":"# Deactivating WooCommerce Subscriptions with WooCommerce Payments active\n\nIf you’re using [WooCommerce Payments](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/), you have two options to sell subscription products:\n\n*   The subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments, or…\n*   The separate [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) extension.\n\nThis document reviews what happens if you are using WooCommerce Payments in addition to the Subscriptions extension, and then you deactivate the Subscriptions extension under **Plugins > Installed Plugins** in your WordPress dashboard.\n\n**NOTE:** WooCommerce Subscriptions and the WooCommerce Payments subscriptions functionality have some [differences in features](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions-basics/comparison/). Please be sure that you are not using any of the features exclusive to the Subscriptions extension before deactivating it.\n\n## [Warning when deactivating Subscriptions](#warning)\n\nIf you go to **Plugins > Installed Plugins** and click the **Deactivate** link for the Subscriptions extension, a popup will warn you of the consequences of doing so:\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-12-09-at-19.37.40-UTC@2x.png)\n\nTo deactivate Subscriptions, click **Yes, deactivate WooCommerce Subscriptions**.

This means that, on their next renewal date, your subscribers will get an email with a link to log into your site and pay for their renewal by hand.\n\nAfter the customer has manually renewed one time, WooCommerce Payments will “take over” the subscription and automatic payments will resume.","metadata":{"title":"Deactivating WooCommerce Subscriptions with WooCommerce Payments active","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/deactivation/"}}],["63",{"pageContent":"After the customer has manually renewed one time, WooCommerce Payments will “take over” the subscription and automatic payments will resume.\n\n## [Effects on new subscriptions](#new-subscriptions)\n\nNew subscriptions will start with WooCommerce Payments from the first transaction, and as such will not need to renewal manually.","metadata":{"title":"Deactivating WooCommerce Subscriptions with WooCommerce Payments active","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/deactivation/"}}],["64",{"pageContent":"# Deposit currencies\n\nWooCommerce Payments can accept payments in [over 100 different currencies](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/available-currencies/).

To avoid these fees, you may be able to have funds in different currencies deposited into separate bank accounts.\n\nWhen using multiple bank accounts, one must be selected as the default. If you receive a payment in a currency that does not match the currency of one of your bank accounts, it will be converted into your default deposit currency and deposit into that default account.\n\n**EXAMPLE:** A store in Germany sells their goods throughout Europe, and has a default bank account in Euro. After adding a second bank account denominated in Swiss francs, payments that use that currency will be deposited into their alternative CHF bank account, while all other payments will be converted to EUR and deposited into the default account.\n\nWooCommerce Payments supports the following countries and deposit currencies.

Although it is rare, sometimes merchants may be affected by card testing attacks.

In the case of a RJ-4250WB, the printer will have 4250WB in its SSID and the password is 425, followed by the last five digits of the serial number, e.g. 42533007.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image3-e1634314803167.png?w=739)","metadata":{"title":"Getting started with In-Person Payments with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/getting-started-with-in-person-payments-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["86",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image3-e1634314803167.png?w=739)\n\nYou can then accept payments (over cellular data) and print receipts (over WiFi Direct). This can be especially useful for in-person delivery at a customer’s home.\n\n### [Why Not Both?](#print-to-both)\n\nSome printers, like the Brother RJ-4250WB-L can be used both with a traditional WiFi network _and_ with WiFi Direct. This is great for maximizing the use of a somewhat expensive printer like the Brother RuggedJet. Android users may also be able to connect to printers, like the Brother RJ-4250WB-L, using Bluetooth as a third option.\n\nThe idea is that, when you have your printer at their place of business, it can be accessed like any other printer on their WiFi network.  But when you take the printer somewhere else, like a customer’s home or trade show, the WiFi Direct mode takes precedence.\n\nFor the Brother RJ-4250WB-L, a special Windows-based **Printer Setting Tool** is needed to set up the WiFi network SSID and password. To get this tool\n\n*   Visit the [Brother website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=eu_ot&lang=en&prod=rj4250wbeuk)\n*   Click on Windows for OS Family and then choose your OS (e.g. Windows 10 (64-bit))\n*   To the right of “Software/Document Installer” click on “Click to choose” and choose your preferred language.\n*   Agree to the EULA, download and run the installer\n*   Connect the RJ-4250WB-L to your computer using a USB Mini-B cable. The port is near the paper opening button:\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image15.png?w=496)\n\n*   After installation completes, launch the Printer Setting Tool, connect to your RJ-4250 over USB, and click on Communication Settings\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image6.png?w=523)\n\n*   Switch to the Wireless LAN tab, then pick Wireless Settings.

They do this by making many individual purchases, each with a different card. Other terms for this activity include “carding” or “card checking.”\n\nThough they are usually rare, the potential for a card testing attack is an unavoidable part of running an online business. WooCommerce Payments does have [some built-in measures](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fraud-prevention/) to prevent or limit the impact of such attacks, but ultimately merchants are responsible for their own fraud prevention.\n\nFortunately, there are many ways you can prevent card testing from harming your site.

This is necessary because all websites that use WooCommerce Payments are [required to be connected](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/#wpcom-account) to WordPress.com.\n\nTo be clear, the new owner does not need to create a new WordPress.com _site_. They only need to create an _account_, which they can do by using the link above.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-19-at-19.08.43-UTC@2x.png)\n\nCreating a user account on WordPress.com\n\n## [Site admin account for new owner](#site-admin-account-for-new-owner)\n\nNext, the existing owner can give the new owner administrator access to the site itself by making an account for them in the WordPress dashboard, under **Users > Add New**. The WordPress.org documentation has [instructions on how to use that page](https://wordpress.org/support/article/users-add-new-screen/).","metadata":{"title":"How do I transfer a site that uses WooCommerce Payments to a new owner?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/transfer-site-to-new-owner/"}}],["106",{"pageContent":"Ensure that the **Role** field is set to “Administrator” in order to give the new owner full access!\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-19-at-19.13.41-UTC@2x.png)\n\nGranting administrator access to a new user account\n\n## [Stripe Express account for new owner](#stripe-express-account-for-new-owner)\n\nThe last account that the new owner will need to create is a [Stripe Express account](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/partnership-with-stripe/), which is what WooCommerce Payments uses to process payments. The old owner will need to invite the new owner to create an account like so:\n\n1.  The old owner should log into their Stripe Express account as detailed [here](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/access-stripe-account/).\n2.  Scroll down, and under _Platform Settings_, click your site name.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-19-at-20.18.28-UTC@2x.png)\n\n3.  In the _Team Members_ section, click the **Invite and remove** box.\n4.  Click the **Add team member** button.\n5.  Enter the email address of the new owner.\n    *   Preferably this is the same email they used for their WordPress.com account and their admin account on the actual website.\n6.  Click the **Invite** button.\n7.  The new owner will receive an invite link from Stripe in their email.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-19-at-20.27.42-UTC@2x.png)\n\n8.  On their device, have the new owner click the **Accept invite** button.\n    *   They will be taken to a Stripe Express account signup page on Stripe’s website.\n9.  The new owner should enter their phone number and click **Next**.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-19-at-20.52.42-UTC@2x.png)","metadata":{"title":"How do I transfer a site that uses WooCommerce Payments to a new owner?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/transfer-site-to-new-owner/"}}],["107",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-19-at-20.52.42-UTC@2x.png)\n\n10.  After validating their phone number by entering a short verification code, the new owner will be able to log into the Stripe Express dashboard and manage the Stripe Express account in the same way that the original owner can.\n\n## [Change business information in Stripe](#change-business-info-in-stripe)\n\nNow that the new owner has access to the site’s Stripe Express dashboard, they should change all the relevant information to reflect the new ownership. For example, the new owner will want to [update the contact details](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/update-my-contact-details/) on file as well as [change the connected bank account(s)](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/change-deposit-account-info/).\n\nEssentially, have the new owner click into each section of the Stripe Express dashboard:\n\n*   Payout Details\n*   Linked External Accounts\n*   Platform Settings\n\n… and update any outdated information that they find.\n\n## [Have Stripe change the owner](#change-stripe-account-ownership)\n\nNext comes the only part of the process that requires a third party: transferring ownership of the Stripe Express account. (The previous sections only resulted in the new owner co-managing the account.) Transferring ownership can only be done by Stripe support.\n\nTo actually transfer ownership of the account, you will need to contact Stripe support by logging in the Express dashboard and clicking the question mark / help icon at the top.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-20-at-14.49.05-UTC@2x.png)\n\nYou’ll land on Stripe’s Help & Support page, and you can contact them by clicking the **Contact Stripe Express support** link.\n\nStripe has advised us that you will need the following information in order to transfer ownership of an Express account:","metadata":{"title":"How do I transfer a site that uses WooCommerce Payments to a new owner?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/transfer-site-to-new-owner/"}}],["108",{"pageContent":"Stripe has advised us that you will need the following information in order to transfer ownership of an Express account:\n\n*   The phone number of the new owner of Express account.\n*   The email address of the new owner of Express account.\n*   A form of verification:\n    *   If a company representative is available, they will set up a call to confirm.\n    *   If a company representative is not available, they will need a verification letter.\n    *   If both the company representative and the old owner/administrator have left the company, they will need a verification letter from a company signatory which confirms and details the change of company representative and the transfer of ownership of the Stripe Express account. A company signatory is someone entitled to sign or execute business contracts on behalf of the organization, such as department directors, VPs, CTO, CFO, CEO, or board members.\n\nOnce Stripe has assisted you in changing the owner of the Stripe Express account, proceed to the next section.\n\n## [WordPress.com connection transfer](#wpcom-connection-transfer)\n\nNow that the new owner has all of the required accounts and information in place, it’s time to transfer ownership of [the WordPress.com connection](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/#wpcom-account) to them.\n\n**NOTE:** It is during this next part of the process that WooCommerce Payments will be unable to take payments. We suggest that you transfer the WordPress.com connection to the new owner as quickly as possible. If you are at all unsure of how to proceed, please [contact our support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) for guidance.","metadata":{"title":"How do I transfer a site that uses WooCommerce Payments to a new owner?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/transfer-site-to-new-owner/"}}],["109",{"pageContent":"To transfer the connection, follow [this process](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/connection/#changing-the-account-you're-connected-to). It can differ based on whether you’re using our [Jetpack plugin](https://jetpack.com/) or not, but the result is the same: the new owner’s WordPress.com account should end up being the one to which the site is connected in our systems.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-4.png)\n\nDisconnecting Jetpack in order to reset the WordPress.com account connection\n\nOnce the new owner has connected the site to WordPress.com using their account, WooCommerce Payments will be able to take payments again!\n\n## [Remove old owner access](#remove-old-owner-access)\n\nThe last step of the process is to remove the old owner’s various accounts.\n\nThe new owner can delete the old owner’s administrator account on the site, under **Users > All Users**. [WordPress.org has documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/users-screen/#delete-users) on how this is done.\n\nThe new owner should also remove the old owner from Stripe Express. To do so:\n\n1.  Log into your Stripe Express account as detailed [on this page](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/access-stripe-account/).\n2.  Scroll down to look under _Platform Settings_ and click your site name.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-19-at-20.18.28-UTC@2x.png)\n\n3.  In the _Team Members_ section, click the **Invite and remove** box.\n4.  Enter the verification code sent to your phone number.\n5.  On the next page, click the **X** icon by the old owner’s account to remove it.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-taken-on-2023-01-20-at-15.35.50-UTC@2x.png)\n\n6.  Click **Remove** in the confirmation modal that appears.\n7.  Click the **Done** button.\n\n## [Finishing up](#finishing-up)","metadata":{"title":"How do I transfer a site that uses WooCommerce Payments to a new owner?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/transfer-site-to-new-owner/"}}],["110",{"pageContent":"6.  Click **Remove** in the confirmation modal that appears.\n7.

This creates a Stripe Express account, which WooCommerce Payments uses in the background for managing your business account information and activity.\n\nAs a result, this Stripe Express account has various bits of information in it, such as details about your business as well as about the individual person who created the account. This information can be updated at a later time, if need be.\n\n**NOTE:** Changing the email or phone number that Stripe has on file is different from changing your _customer support_ email or phone number as shown [in the Settings Guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/#customer-support).

This data is separate from the billing field data, such as the card number and CVC code.\n\n## [What about saved cards and subscriptions?](#what-about-saved-cards-and-subscriptions)\n\nWhen a customer completes a purchase on your site and chooses to save their payment method for future use, or when they purchase a subscription product, your site needs to “remember” the customer’s payment details in order to use them again in the future.\n\nWooCommerce Payments uses a token and API-based method to do this. In short, this means your site will communicate with our payments system using [the WordPress.com connection](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/connection/) and request the card details using a payment token. Payment method details such as the card number and CVC code are not stored directly on your site.\n\n## [Further reading](#futher-reading)","metadata":{"title":"Is WooCommerce Payments PCI Compliant?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/pci-compliance/"}}],["123",{"pageContent":"## [Further reading](#futher-reading)\n\nWooCommerce Payments is [built in partnership with Stripe](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/).

Handling disputes from customers can be one of the most unpleasant parts of running a business, especially when you need to challenge a dispute. However, not responding to your disputes can be problematic, because it can lead to fines and the possibility of being prohibited to do business by the card networks.\n\nThis guide provides you with guidance on how to respond to existing disputes. For more information on how to prevent disputes in the first place, please see [this document](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/preventing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/).\n\n## [Overview](#section-1)\n\nWooCommerce Payments guides you through the process of responding to a dispute via the [**Payments > Disputes** page](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/#section-7). This document expands on information provided within those pages, and provides advice about the types of responses recommended for different types of disputes.\n\nFor each dispute type, it also provides the information required to overturn the dispute, and where to include that evidence in the fields presented by the **Challenge Dispute** form. When responding to a dispute, it’s always best to provide more information. If you have any information you think the card issuer might want to see, submit it as dispute evidence. Some example dispute evidence includes web logs, email communications, shipment tracking numbers, delivery confirmations, proof of prior refunds, replacement shipments, and so on.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/woocommerce-payments-challenge-dispute.png?w=950)\n\n**Payments > Disputes > Challenge Dispute** Evidence Submission Screen\n\n## [Responding to a dispute](#section-2)\n\nAfter your store receives a dispute, you can respond in one or three ways:","metadata":{"title":"Managing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/managing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["126",{"pageContent":"**Payments > Disputes > Challenge Dispute** Evidence Submission Screen\n\n## [Responding to a dispute](#section-2)\n\nAfter your store receives a dispute, you can respond in one or three ways:\n\n*   **Do nothing**: in which case, the dispute will be marked _Lost_ after the due date is reached.\n*   **Accept dispute**: accepting the dispute immediately marks it as _Lost_. The funds withdrawn from your account to cover the transaction and [dispute fee](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/) will not be reimbursed.\n*   **Challenge dispute**: submit evidence to card issuer proving that the dispute is not valid. The evidence will be reviewed by the card issuer and you will receive their determination at a later date, which can be a number of months in future.\n\n**NOTE:** One thing you should **not** do is refund the customer for their disputed order using some other method besides WooCommerce Payments. This is because, if you lose the dispute later on, the amount of the order will automatically be refunded to them from your WooCommerce Payments account. Thus, you will then have lost **two times** the amount of the order, plus the $15 dispute fee.\n\nThe first two responses are the most efficient way to resolve a dispute. If you think the dispute is valid, or do not have the required evidence to challenge the dispute, you should accept the dispute. The card networks do not take into account the number of disputes you lose when determining the risk of your business. They look at the number of disputes your business receives.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/woocommerce-payments-dispute-details.png?w=736)\n\n**NOTE:** If you decide to challenge a dispute, evidence can only be submitted one time. For that reason, be sure to carefully review any evidence you plan to submit! Once the evidence has been submitted, it’s not possible (even for WooCommerce Payments support staff) to correct any mistakes.\n\n### [Contact your customer](#section-3)","metadata":{"title":"Managing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/managing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["127",{"pageContent":"### [Contact your customer](#section-3)\n\nWith any dispute, we recommend that you contact your customer to discuss the claim. Sometimes, customers may mistakenly dispute a charge and once reminded of the transaction, they can withdraw the dispute with their card issuer.\n\nImportantly, even if your customer does withdraw the dispute, you still need to challenge the dispute in order for the transaction to be refunded and dispute fee returned. It will also still take approximately 75 days to be closed by the card issuer.\n\n## [Dispute types](#section-4)\n\nCard issuers categorize disputes in one of the following ways, base on the claim by the card holder:","metadata":{"title":"Managing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/managing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["128",{"pageContent":"## [Dispute types](#section-4)\n\nCard issuers categorize disputes in one of the following ways, base on the claim by the card holder:\n\n*   **[Credit not processed](#credit-not-processed)**: card holder claims they are owed a refund or other credit that has not been received. For example, if your customer returns a product, but the charge has not been refunded to the card.\n*   **[Duplicate](#duplicate)**: customer claims multiple charges were placed on their card for the same product or service. For example, if your customer paid for a service when booking via your website, as well as in person after receiving the service.\n*   **[Fraudulent](#fraudulent)**: card holder, not necessarily the customer with your store, claims they did not authorize the payment with your store. For example, if your customer used a stolen credit card number to place an order, the holder of that card may later see the transaction and dispute it as it is not recognized.\n*   **[General](#general) or [Unrecognized](#unrecognized):** the card holder notifies their card issuer that they do not recognize the charge on their card statement.\n*   **[Product not received](#product-not-received)**: the good or service for which the charge was processed has not been received by the customer. For example, a shipment from your business has not been received by your customer.\n*   **[Product unacceptable](#product-unacceptable)**: the card holder claims the product or service they received in return for the payment was defective, damaged, or not as described. For example, your customer was shipped a different item to the one purchased.\n*   **[Subscription cancelled](#subscription-cancelled)**: after cancelling a subscription plan, the customer was charged a recurring payment for that subscription. For example, if a customer calls your business to request cancellation, but the subscription is not cancelled within WooCommerce.","metadata":{"title":"Managing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/managing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["129",{"pageContent":"Because each type of dispute represents a different claim by the customer, each requires different evidence to be submitted when challenging the dispute.

This evidence proves that the cardholder participated in the transaction, received any goods or services, or benefited from the transaction.\n\nWhile compelling evidence is only required by Visa, we recommended you collect and submit this evidence regardless of the card brand used in the transaction.\n\nYou can learn more about Visa’s compelling evidence requirements in [their online courses](https://www.visauniversity.com/en/catalog/liveonline/introduction-to-dispute-resolution).\n\n## [Dispute Decisions](#section-28)","metadata":{"title":"Managing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/managing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["146",{"pageContent":"## [Dispute Decisions](#section-28)\n\nAlthough WooCommerce Payments is used to submit evidence and challenge the dispute, the dispute outcome is determined exclusively by the bank. Neither Automattic nor our financial service providers influence the decision outside of submitting the evidence to them.

However, their dispute process works differently than that of other payment methods.\n\nAfter paying with SEPA, customers can dispute a payment through their bank on a “no questions asked” basis up to eight weeks after their account is debited. **The customer will automatically win any dispute filed within this time period.**\n\nAfter eight weeks and up to 13 months, a customer can only dispute a payment with their bank if the debit is considered unauthorized. If this occurs, WooCommerce Payments automatically provides the bank with the mandate that the customer approved. This does not guarantee cancellation of the dispute however: the bank can still decide that the debit was unauthorized and the customer is entitled to a refund.","metadata":{"title":"Managing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/managing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["147",{"pageContent":"# Managing Money with WooCommerce Payments\n\nAlthough WooCommerce Payments makes charging your customers as easy as possible, it’s still helpful to be familiar with the various ways in which money can move through your site and your account.

It should be gone, as if they never transacted with you at all.\n\n## [Disputes](#disputes)\n\nA dispute (also called a “chargeback”) occurs when a card owner questions a payment with their bank.

You also have the option of setting a manual rate when [managing a currency](#section-5), which will override the automatic rate.\n\nDisclaimer: Exchange rates are not accurate to the minute and may differ from what you’ll find when looking at historical exchange rates. The exchange rates will also vary slightly from the rate used at the time of transaction.\n\n## [Managing a Customer Currency](#section-5)\n\nClicking on the manage link in a currency row takes you to a new settings screen for that specific customer currency.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-07-24-at-15.34.29.png?w=950)\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pasted-image.png?w=950)\n\n### [Exchange Rate](#section-6)\n\nUse the exchange rate setting to choose between a manual and an automated rate. Automatic rate fetching is selected by default. \n\nManual rate allows you to specify your own fixed rate of exchange, which will take priority over the automatic rate if it is set.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-07-24-at-15.38.10.png?w=950)\n\n### [Formatting rules](#section-7)","metadata":{"title":"Multi-Currency with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/currencies/multi-currency-setup/"}}],["158",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-07-24-at-15.38.10.png?w=950)\n\n### [Formatting rules](#section-7)\n\nFormatting rules create consistency in your converted product prices, without having to adjust prices individually on each product. \n\n#### **Price rounding**\n\nPrice rounding always rounds the converted price **up** to the nearest amount selected. For example, if a converted price product price is 5.32, and price rounding is set to 0.50, it will round the converted price up to 5.50. If price rounding is set to 1.00, it will round the converted price up to 6.00, and so on. For decimal currencies, price rounding is set to 1.00 by default. For non-decimal currencies, price rounding is set to 100 by default. \n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rounding.png?w=950)\n\n#### **Price charm**\n\n‘Price charming’, also known as ‘psychological pricing’, reduces the converted price by a specific amount.  It is a pricing strategy that reduces the price by either 0.01 or 0.05 as prices slightly less than a whole round number (e.g. $1.99 instead of $2) are perceived as more attractive to a consumer. Price charm is set to None by default. \n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/price_chamrming_wcpay.png?w=950)\n\n### [Previewing converted prices](#section-8)\n\nEnter a hypothetical product price using your store’s default currency to view the amount converted to the customer currency using the selections from the formatting section above. \n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/preview_conversion.png?w=950)\n\n## [Currency switching](#section-9)\n\nIf you would like your customers to be able to choose their currency from the front-end of your site, and you are not using a theme that supports this by default, you will need to make use of the currency switcher block or widget.\n\n### [Block](#section-10)","metadata":{"title":"Multi-Currency with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/currencies/multi-currency-setup/"}}],["159",{"pageContent":"### [Block](#section-10)\n\nTo add the block, edit any post, page, or (more commonly) widget area.

Handling disputes from customers can be one of the most unpleasant parts of running a business. The best way to avoid that unpleasantness is to stop disputes from occurring in the first place. There are a number of tactics you can use to do this, which are discussed in this document.\n\nIt’s also helpful to keep in mind that there is always _some_ risk that a customer will dispute their purchase, regardless of the payment gateway or platform you are using for your store. In other words, your goal should not be to have absolutely no disputes. Rather, your goal should be to minimize the odds of a dispute occurring.\n\nFor guidance on how to respond to disputes after they’ve been filed, please refer to the document on [managing disputes](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/disputes/).\n\n## [Know your customer](#know-your-customer)\n\nThe more information you collect about your customer during the checkout process, the easier it is for their bank to verify that the purchase is legitimate. You should strongly consider collecting the following details, even if they aren’t strictly necessary for your own business operations.\n\n*   Customer name\n*   Customer email\n*   CVC number on their card\n*   Full billing address and post code\n*   Shipping address (if different from billing)\n\n## [Be responsive](#be-responsive)\n\nMany disputes occur because customers are unhappy with the product or service they received. If you are helpful and responsive to your customers (for example, by handling issues quickly or refunding orders in a timely manner), they will be less likely to file a dispute.\n\nHere are some specific tips that may help prevent disputes:","metadata":{"title":"Preventing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/preventing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["163",{"pageContent":"Here are some specific tips that may help prevent disputes:\n\n*   On your website, make your [contact details](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/#customer-support), refund policy, and customer service information easily available so that customers can reach out to you should they encounter any issues.\n*   Check to make sure that the default [WooCommerce emails](https://woocommerce.com/document/configuring-woocommerce-settings/#email-settings), which keep your customers updated about the status of their orders, are all enabled.\n*   Consider having a [“Terms and Conditions” checkbox](https://woocommerce.com/document/configuring-woocommerce-settings/#terms-and-conditions) that customers must complete before placing an order. This makes your store’s terms more discoverable during checkout.\n*   If you ship physical items, provide [tracking information](https://woocommerce.com/products/shipment-tracking/) to customers as soon as possible.\n*   Ensure that your store’s bank statement descriptor follows [our suggested guidelines](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/bank-statement-descriptor/).\n\n## [Avoid fraud](#avoid-fraud)\n\nWooCommerce Payments has [built-in measures to prevent fraud](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fraud-prevention/), but ultimately merchants are responsible for their own fraud prevention.

Through this partnership, WooCommerce can connect you with Stripe Capital to offer small business loans originated by Celtic Bank. Stripe helps WooCommerce identify merchants using WooCommerce Payments who may be eligible for these loans, so be on the lookout for an email about eligibility for a Stripe Capital loan.\n\n## Frequently asked questions \n\n### [How do you determine who qualifies for an offer?](#how-do-you-determine-who-qualifies-for-an-offer)\n\nEligibility is determined based on a combination of factors, including overall sales volume and history with WooCommerce. Eligible U.S. businesses will receive an email if they have an offer available. \n\n### [Do I have to pay interest?](#do-i-have-to-pay-interest)\n\nNo, you’ll pay one flat fee that does not change. You won’t pay any interest on top of this fee.\n\n### [Will applying for an offer affect my credit score?](#will-applying-for-an-offer-affect-my-credit-score)\n\nNo, there is no credit check. All offers are based solely on your history with WooCommerce. \n\n### [Can I request a different offer amount?](#can-i-request-a-different-offer-amount)\n\nYou can use a slider to choose a custom amount (up to the maximum offer amount). The loan fee and repayment rate adjust based on the amount you choose.\n\n### [When do I need to pay the flat fee?](#when-do-i-need-to-pay-the-flat-fee)\n\nYou’ll automatically pay the flat fee via a percentage of your sales until the total amount owed is repaid. The fee is not charged up-front. \n\n### **How does repayment work?** \n\nRepayment is collected automatically through a percentage of your WooCommerce sales, which means you pay down more when business is busy and less if things slow down. As long as you meet your minimum payment requirement every 60 days, what you pay each day adjusts to your sales.\n\n### [What is a minimum payment?](#what-is-a-minimum-payment)","metadata":{"title":"Stripe Capital FAQ","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/stripe-capital-faq/"}}],["166",{"pageContent":"### [What is a minimum payment?](#what-is-a-minimum-payment)\n\nA minimum payment is the minimum amount that you’re expected to repay every 60 days such that the maximum duration of the loan does not exceed 18 months. If the total amount that you repay through payments deducted from your sales in a 60-day period falls below the minimum payment requirement, you will be required to pay the remaining amount at the end of the period. You can view your minimum payment amount in the Dashboard or in your loan agreement.  \n\n### [How do I make my minimum payment?](#how-do-i-make-my-minimum-payment)\n\nIf the portion deducted from your sales covers the minimum payment requirement for the 60-day period, no additional action will be taken. If you have not met the minimum payment amount by the end of the 60-day period, Stripe will automatically debit your bank account for the remaining amount needed to meet your minimum payment. This will occur automatically, so there is no need to make a manual payment.\n\n### [After I accept an offer, how quickly will I get my funds?](#after-i-accept-an-offer-how-quickly-will-i-get-my-funds)\n\nIf your application is approved, you’ll see the funds in your bank account typically in 1-2 business days.\n\n### [What happens when my offer expires?](#what-happens-when-my-offer-expires)\n\nEach offer is available for 30 days.

There are no additional fees for early repayment.\n\n### **Will repaying early qualify me for a new offer?** \n\nOnce you repay the total amount owed, you’ll automatically be evaluated for a new offer.

They will need to log into the merchant website and pay for the order manually, at which point the subscription will resume (until the next renewal, when it will fail again).\n\n### [Subscriptions created after version 5.2.0](#section-12)","metadata":{"title":"Subscriptions with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions-basics/"}}],["173",{"pageContent":"### [Subscriptions created after version 5.2.0](#section-12)\n\nCustomers who initiate subscriptions while the merchant’s site is running WooCommerce Payments **5.2.0 or later** will have a much better experience. The initial purchase will be subject to [3DS](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/3d-secure/), but after that, renewals happen automatically and without customer interaction.\n\nThere is one exception: renewals that exceed 15,000 Indian rupees (INR) will require an additional manual verification process via the customer’s bank.\n\nAlso, please note that [payment method updates](https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/customers-view/#section-11) on these subscriptions will not work yet, although a fix for that is in development by our engineering team.\n\n### [Updating existing subscriptions](#section-13)\n\nIf you have subscriptions on your site created with a WooCommerce Payments version prior to 5.2.0, and wish to allow your customers to get the newer, more convenient automatic renewals, the best method for doing that is to simply [cancel their existing subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/store-manager-guide/#cancel-or-suspend-subscription) when their existing term is over, and then advise the customers to start a fresh subscription.\n\nIt’s likely best to communicate this plan to your customers ahead of time though, as cancelling their subscriptions will send them an automated email, which could cause confusion if they see it with no advance warning.\n\n## [Migrating](#section-14)\n\nIf you’re using [WooCommerce Payments](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/), you have two options to sell subscription products:\n\n*   The subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments, or…\n*   The [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) extension mentioned above.","metadata":{"title":"Subscriptions with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions-basics/"}}],["174",{"pageContent":"*   The subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments, or…\n*   The [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) extension mentioned above.\n\nIf you are already using one subscription offering and want to migrate to the other option, please refer to our guides here:\n\n*   [Moving from Subscriptions to WooCommerce Payments](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/built-in-subscriptions/moving-from-subscriptions-plugin/)\n*   [Moving from WooCommerce Payments to Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/upgrade-to-extension/)","metadata":{"title":"Subscriptions with WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions-basics/"}}],["175",{"pageContent":"# Switching from Stripe to WooCommerce Payments\n\nIf you would like to stop using the Stripe extension and switch to WooCommerce Payments instead, this document describes how to do that with as little disruption as possible to your site and your customers.\n\nBecause the process is a little different depending on whether or not your store utilizes our [Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), and whether or not you plan to keep using it after switching off of Stripe, we’ve split this guide into three sections:\n\n*   [No subscription products in the store](#no-subscriptions-products)\n*   [Continue using the Subscriptions extension](#continue-using-subscriptions-extension)\n*   [Move to WooCommerce Payments subscriptions](#move-to-wcpay-subscriptions)\n\nPlease consult [our comparison of the two](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/comparison/) subscriptions options if you’re unsure about which one is best for your store.\n\n## [No subscriptions products](#no-subscriptions-products)\n\nThe following instructions are for stores that do not sell subscription products.

This is because, as mentioned above, if you deactivated the Stripe plugin immediately, you would not be able to issue refunds and such for orders that were placed with Stripe.\n\nThus, it’s best to keep the Stripe plugin active for few months even after you’ve disabled it as a payment method, just to lower the chance that you will need to refund any customers who did pay with Stripe.\n\n### [Deactivate Stripe](#deactivate-stripe)\n\nAfter some time has passed, and refunds for orders that were originally placed via Stripe are unlikely, you can go ahead and deactivate it under **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.\n\n## [Continue using Subscriptions extension](#continue-using-subscriptions-extension)","metadata":{"title":"Switching from Stripe to WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/switching-from-stripe-to-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["177",{"pageContent":"## [Continue using Subscriptions extension](#continue-using-subscriptions-extension)\n\nIf you sell subscription products on your site using Stripe and the [Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), and you want to switch to WooCommerce Payments and the Subscriptions extension, this section explains how to do that.\n\n### [Install and sign up](#keep-subs-install-and-sign-up)\n\nFirst, install and sign up for WooCommerce Payments as shown in [our Startup Guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/#installation).\n\nAfter you finish signing up, WooCommerce Payments will be active and able to take payments right alongside the Stripe extension.

As such, it’s important to be proactive and communicate with your customers ahead of time. If you have a small number of subscribers, you may be able to email them by hand. If your subscriber base is large, we suggest using [AutomateWoo](https://woocommerce.com/products/automatewoo/) to email them all at once.\n\nEssentially, you should warn them that their subscriptions will soon be set to [renew manually](https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/renewal-process/#section-4) as a part of the switching process. To switch back to automatic renewals, your email should instruct customers to log into the site immediately after receiving the message and update their payment method. This will resume automatic payments going forward with minimal disruption.\n\nFor convenience, your email should include a link to the **My Account > Subscriptions** page, which is at this URL by default:\n\n`https://www.example.com/my-account/subscriptions/`\n\nThis will help customers go directly to their dashboard and update the payment methods on their subscriptions. By clicking into each subscription, they can see which ones are on manual renewal, and thus which ones they need to add payments methods to.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-16-at-14.53.46-UTC@2x.png)\n\nA subscription on manual renewal and in need of a payment method.","metadata":{"title":"Switching from Stripe to WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/switching-from-stripe-to-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["179",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-16-at-14.53.46-UTC@2x.png)\n\nA subscription on manual renewal and in need of a payment method.\n\nIf you elect to use AutomateWoo to email your subscribers, the workflow would look very similar to the one for [onboarding subscribers without a payment method](https://automatewoo.com/docs/examples/subscription-workflows/onboard-woocommerce-subscriptions-to-automatic-renewals/). The only difference would be that your workflow should be run manually, immediately after the next section.\n\n### [Set subscriptions to manual renewal](#keep-subs-set-manual-renewal)\n\nNow that you have your email prepared and ready to send to subscribers, it’s time to set their subscriptions to manual renewal. To do this:\n\n1.  Go to **WooCommerce > Subscriptions** in your dashboard.\n2.  Find a subscription that uses the Stripe payment method, like so:\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-11-at-20.26.39-UTC@2x.png)\n\nA subscription that uses Stripe for renewal payments.\n\n3.  Click the subscription ID number to edit the subscription.\n4.  In the _Billing_ section, click the pencil icon.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-11-at-20.28.04-UTC@2x.png)\n\nEditing the Billing section of a subscription.\n\n5.  In the _Payment Method_ dropdown, select **Manual Renewal**.\n6.  Click the **Update** button to save the subscription.\n7.  Repeat those steps for every subscription that uses Stripe for renewals.\n\nIf you have a small number of subscribers using Stripe, this method might be feasible. If you have a large number of subscribers, however, we again suggest using [AutomateWoo](https://woocommerce.com/products/automatewoo/) to set them all to manual renewal at once. The workflow might look like the one below, although that is not guaranteed to work for every use case.","metadata":{"title":"Switching from Stripe to WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/switching-from-stripe-to-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["180",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-11-at-20.47.14-UTC@2x.png)\n\nAutomateWoo workflow to set all Stripe subscriptions to Manual Renewal.\n\nIf you need help creating an equivalent AutomateWoo workflow, please [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/).\n\n### [Send email to subscription customers](#keep-subs-send-email)\n\nNow that you’ve actually set all the Stripe subscriptions to renew manually, you can send the email (or run the AutomateWoo workflow) you prepared in [the previous section](#keep-subs-prep-email).\n\nThis will prompt all your subscribers to log in and quickly update their payment method in order to avoid the hassle of renewing manually in the future.\n\n### [Waiting period](#keep-subs-wait-for-renewals)\n\nOnce the email is sent, you may get questions from some subscribers about the switch, how to renew, etc. It’s best to watch your email inbox carefully to avoid losing customers. It will take some time for all of them to add payment methods to WooCommerce Payments, but over time their subscriptions should be switched over.\n\nWe also advise keeping the Stripe plugin enabled for at least a couple of months, even though it’s currently disabled as a payment method. This is because, if you deactivated the Stripe plugin immediately, you would not be able to issue refunds for orders that were placed with Stripe.\n\nAs such, it’s best to keep the Stripe plugin active for few months before deactivating it.\n\n### [Deactivate Stripe](#keep-subs-deactivate-stripe)\n\nAfter some time has passed, and refunds for orders that were originally placed via Stripe are unlikely, you can go ahead and deactivate it under **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.\n\n## [Move to WooCommerce Payments subscriptions](#move-to-wcpay-subscriptions)","metadata":{"title":"Switching from Stripe to WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/switching-from-stripe-to-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["181",{"pageContent":"## [Move to WooCommerce Payments subscriptions](#move-to-wcpay-subscriptions)\n\nIf you sell subscription products on your site using Stripe and the [Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), and you want to switch to WooCommerce Payments and its built-in subscriptions functionality, this section explains how to do that.\n\n### [Install and sign up](#stop-subs-install-and-sign-up)\n\nFirst, install and sign up for WooCommerce Payments as shown in [our Startup Guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/#installation).\n\nAfter you finish signing up, WooCommerce Payments will be active and able to take payments right alongside the Stripe extension.

Specifically, your current subscribers will need to log into the site at least once to add a payment method to WooCommerce Payments. This is what allows future renewals to take place automatically.\n\nAs such, it’s important to be proactive and communicate with your customers about this ahead of time. If you have a small number of subscribers, you may be able to email them by hand. If your subscriber base is large, we suggest using [AutomateWoo](https://woocommerce.com/products/automatewoo/) to email them all at once.\n\nEssentially, you should warn them that their subscriptions will soon be set to renew manually. What will happen is that, on their next renewal date, WooCommerce will automatically email them an invoice. That invoice will contain a link they can click to pay for their renewal order.\n\nBy clicking the link and paying for their renewal via WooCommerce Payments, that payment method will be saved to their subscription and used in the future for automatic renewals. In other words, they will only need to manually renew one time.\n\n### [Disable Subscriptions extension](#stop-subs-deactivate)\n\nNow that you’ve warned your customers about what’s happening, it’s time to set their subscriptions to manual renewal. Since you plan on switching from the Subscription extension to the WooCommerce Payments built-in subscriptions functionality, you can do this by simply deactivating the Subscriptions extension under **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-14-at-19.30.49-UTC@2x.png)\n\nDeactivating the Subscriptions extension","metadata":{"title":"Switching from Stripe to WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/switching-from-stripe-to-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["183",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-14-at-19.30.49-UTC@2x.png)\n\nDeactivating the Subscriptions extension\n\nYou will see a modal warning you about deactivating Subscriptions, like so:\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-11-14-at-19.39.16-UTC@2x.png)\n\nModal warning seen when deactivating WooCommerce Subscriptions extension\n\nClick **Yes, deactivate WooCommerce Subscriptions** to deactivate the plugin. This will set all of your Subscriptions (not just those paid with Stripe) to manual renewal.\n\n### [Waiting period](#stop-subs-wait-for-renewals)\n\nNow that all of your subscribers are set to renew manually, all you need to do is wait for their next renewal dates. At that point, they will each get an email with instructions on how to log into the site to pay for their subscription renewal.\n\nOnce they renew manually and pay via WooCommerce Payments, a subscription will be created for them using the built-in subscriptions functionality in WooCommerce Payments.\n\nWe also advise keeping the Stripe plugin enabled for at least a couple of months, even though it’s currently disabled as a payment method. This is because, if you deactivated the Stripe plugin immediately, you would not be able to issue refunds for orders that were placed with Stripe.\n\nAs such, it’s best to keep the Stripe plugin active for few months before deactivating it.\n\n### [Deactivate Stripe](#stop-subs-deactivate-stripe)\n\nAfter some time has passed, and refunds for orders that were originally placed via Stripe are unlikely, you can go ahead and deactivate it under **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.","metadata":{"title":"Switching from Stripe to WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/switching-from-stripe-to-woocommerce-payments/"}}],["184",{"pageContent":"# Testing WooCommerce Payments\n\nThis document provides instructions for testing payments, refunds, disputes, and the other functions of WooCommerce Payments.

Each time he uses the minicart to modify his selection, by adding or removing products, we need to make sure to have all product information handy in order to send pixel events with all relevant data to Google, Meta (Facebook), etc. Unfortunately it is not possible to include this information on page load within the HTML code, because caching mechanisms could serve outdated data to the browser. That’s why we need a mechanism like `wpm_get_cart_items` that will fetch all the current product data for the minicart from the server.\n\nAnd now to the question _if_ `wpm_get_cart_items` is slowing down the website.\n\nSome users have noticed in the network tab of their browsers that the `wpm_get_cart_items` call adds one more request, which on slow servers can take even more than a second to fullfil. It is using the standard WordPress Ajax function to fetch the product data.","metadata":{"title":"Troubleshooting WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/troubleshooting/"}}],["194",{"pageContent":"But is this **not** slowing down the website?\n\nThe `wpm_get_cart_items` call happens **after** the browser has signalled the `load` event, _which happens after all content has already been successfully loaded_.\n\n**INFO**\n\nThe load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images.\n\nReference: [Mozilla MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event)\n\n**INFO**\n\nPageSpeed measures the loading time of your page starting from the initial request to when the last embedded resource (JS, CSS, images, etc.) has finished loading.

But it can’t persist over Elemetor updates, so you need to keep updating this with every Elementor update. Use it at your own risk.\n\nWe’d recommend that you give the issue a thumbs up or add your own comment so that the Elementor developers see how frequently that problem happens and increase the priority of that issue.\n\nWe’re in direct contact with Elementor, but at the moment we can’t say for sure if and when they are going to fix this on their end.\n\n### [The Purchase Confirmation Page Doesn’t Load and Shows a Blank Page​](#the-purchase-confirmation-page-doesnt-load-and-shows-a-blank-page)","metadata":{"title":"Troubleshooting WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/troubleshooting/"}}],["196",{"pageContent":"### [The Purchase Confirmation Page Doesn’t Load and Shows a Blank Page​](#the-purchase-confirmation-page-doesnt-load-and-shows-a-blank-page)\n\nIf a blank page shows up when trying to load the purchase confirmation page the reason is typically too low allocated memory.

You just have to paste the Site ID from HotJar’s tracking code to Pixel Manager and you’re good to go.  \n  \nHowever, sometimes, there will be instances where your site can’t be verified. Usually, it’s because of these things:\n\n1.  **Cookie Banner** – make sure that you have disabled the cookie banner when verifying your site on HotJar. This sometimes blocks the cookies coming from HotJar as well causing it not to verify successfully\n2.  **Explicit Consent Mode** – having this option enabled in the plugin will also not allow cookie tracking on your site. Just like the Cookie Banner, this will also cause your site’s verification to be unsuccessful\n3.  **You’re logged in while verifying** – You also have to do the verification while you’re logged out on your WordPress Dashboard so your site will be tracked.\n4.  **Server-side caching** – Make sure to clear all server-side caches after each configuration so the HotJar verifier will not load a cached version.\n\n### [Duplicate jQuery library causes random issues​](#duplicate-jquery-library-causes-random-issues)\n\n**Problem**\n\nThe theme, a plugin, or a custom code that loads an additional jQuery library overwrites the events the Pixel Manager hooks into.\n\nWordPress for a long time was shipped with an old version of jQuery. Therefore, some theme developers or shop managers loaded an additional, newer jQuery library in the HTML source. But, if done incorrectly, this would overwrite all events a plugin like the Pixel Manager has hooked into, rendering all event listeners useless.\n\nLuckily WordPress, since version 5.5, is shipped with the most modern jQuery library. This means the additional jQuery library can be safely removed.\n\n**Verification**","metadata":{"title":"Troubleshooting WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/troubleshooting/"}}],["198",{"pageContent":"Luckily WordPress, since version 5.5, is shipped with the most modern jQuery library.

Users of the Elementor Pro widget for related and upsell products. For them, we have an own support article with a workaround: [Elementor Render Issue](https://sweetcode.com/docs/wpm/troubleshooting#elementor-related-products-and-upsell-products-widgets)\n2.  The theme is using a front end JavaScript library which makes a mistake when rendering the code that the Pixel Manager injects into the product templates. The Pixel Manager injects the following three HTML elements into the page source: `<meta>`, `<input type=\"hidden\">` and `<script></script>`. All those HTML elements **are invisible elements by definition** and should not be visibly rendered. However, some JavaScript helper libraries don’t account for those invisible elements and render some or all of them visibly nonetheless.This needs to be fixed by the developers of those render libraries.

Either they are sent correctly and matched by our plugin, or they are not sent at all.\n\nThe usual explanation for this warning is one or several of the following:\n\n*   You recently enabled Meta (Facebook) CAPI. In that case, Meta (Facebook) sometimes, unfortunately, mixes up old with new values and generates this warning. Fortunately, this transitory situation is only temporary and resolves just by waiting a few days. In this case the recommendation is to simply dismiss the warning. If the warning shows up again, have a look at the other possible reasons. If the issue you are encountering is not listed, feel free to contact support.\n*   You are running a second instance of the Meta (Facebook) pixel through another plugin or custom code. If that is the case then that code is missing the correct match keys and causes the warning. Please disable additional Meta (Facebook) plugins and/or remove additional custom Meta (Facebook) code. Then dismiss the warning in Meta (Facebook). If the warning reappears, go ahead and contact support.\n\n### [Purchase Event delay from the server (Conversion API)​](#purchase-event-delay-from-server-conversion-api)","metadata":{"title":"Troubleshooting WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/troubleshooting/"}}],["203",{"pageContent":"### [Purchase Event delay from the server (Conversion API)​](#purchase-event-delay-from-server-conversion-api)\n\nUnder normal conditions, the plugin sends the purchase event immediately to Meta (Facebook). But, when a payment for the order fails, no purchase event is being sent through the Conversion API. Only when the payment on that order is recovered at a later point in time, then the purchase event is sent to Meta (Facebook). This can lead to a `Purchase Event delay from server` warning. It can be safely ignored.\n\n### [Potentially violating Personal data sent to Meta (Facebook)​](#potentially-violating-personal-data-sent-to-facebook)\n\nThis happens when Meta (Facebook) detects URL parameters that potentially contain personal data (PII) in the path of the URL.\n\nExample: `http://example.com/account/reset-password?username=johndoe`\n\nIn this case Meta (Facebook) detects that `username` probably contains personal information, issues a warning and redacts the information like this: `http://example.com/account/reset-password?username=_removed_`\n\n> Our plugin does not add any information to the URL path. The only information that our plugin is sending through the browser pixel is product and order data. The source of this warning are URL paths generated by the server and must be fixed there.\n\nMeta (Facebook) in some cases is “trigger happy” and issues a warning although there is no personal data in the URL path.\n\nExample: `http://example.com?_ip=123456`\n\nIn this case `_ip=123456` resembles an IP address, but in your case, it might be something completely different. If you are sure it is not personal information, you can safely ignore the warning.\n\n### [I am getting “Failed to load resource: net::ERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT”​](#i-am-getting-failed-to-load-resource-neterr_blocked_by_client)\n\nThis is usually caused by an ad-blocker in the browser.\n\nIn order to fix this, temporarily disable the ad-blocker or switch to another browser that doesn’t have an ad-blocker enabled.","metadata":{"title":"Troubleshooting WooCommerce Payments","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/troubleshooting/"}}],["204",{"pageContent":"This is usually caused by an ad-blocker in the browser.\n\nIn order to fix this, temporarily disable the ad-blocker or switch to another browser that doesn’t have an ad-blocker enabled.\n\nRead more about this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22403173/4688612).\n\n## [Incompatible Plugins​](#incompatible-plugins)\n\n### [WC Custom Thank You](#wc-custom-thank-you)\n\n> Plugin homepage: [link](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-custom-thank-you/)\n\n**INFO**\n\nThe plugin creates a custom order thankyou page for WooCommerce, but doesn’t follow the WooCommerce standard for the order confirmation page.

The plugin can only send the signal for one or the other, not for both (which would not make sense anyway). So one of those verticals never receives an ID (usually `custom`), in which case you will see that warning show up regularly, but usually can dismiss it. Unfortunately the `custom` vertical can not be turned off once enabled.\n*   There is some reason that is blocking the remarketing script from sending events correctly, usually some kind of JavaScript optimization plugin.\n\nMake sure that none of the above reasons are causing this problem.\n\nThe best way to check if the ID is being sent is to use the [Google Tag Assistant](https://tagassistant.google.com/)\n\nHere’s how to check:\n\n1\\.

This is called the “pending period.” Second, there’s how often any available deposits are actually sent to your bank account. This is called the “deposit schedule.”\n\nThe pending period is a standard rolling delay that is determined by the country your business operates in. See the chart below for details on that. The deposit schedule [can be changed](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/how-do-i-change-my-deposit-schedule-with-woocommerce-payments/#section-2) to suit the needs of your business.\n\nAs an example: a merchant based in Canada has a pending period of 7 business days. If a customer purchases from their store on Monday, those fund are added to the merchant’s account balance right away, but not available for deposit until the following Tuesday, 7 business days later. After that, when the funds are sent to their bank depends on the merchant’s deposit schedule.  \n  \nIf the merchant has a daily deposit schedule, the deposit including those funds will be sent on the following Tuesday. As mentioned above, this would be 7 business days from the initial purchase. If the merchant is on a weekly deposit schedule on Thursdays, for example, the funds would be sent on the coming Thursday, a total of 9 business days after the initial purchase.  \n  \nAnother example: a business in New Zealand has a pending period of 4 business days. If that business has a daily deposit schedule, payments made to this account on a Wednesday will be paid out on the following Tuesday. If they have a weekly deposit schedule set for Fridays, the payment would be paid out on the following Friday.","metadata":{"title":"When will I receive deposits for my WooCommerce Payments account balance?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/deposit-schedule/"}}],["230",{"pageContent":"Most banks will reflect the deposit in your account as soon as they receive the transfer from WooCommerce Payments.

The waiting period starts after the first successful charge is processed on your account, not when the account is created.\n\nAfter the 7 day waiting period for an account is over, the regular pending period will apply, per the chart below. Deposits will begin to be delivered according to the deposit schedule determined for that account.\n\nNote that delays in bank processing times due to weekends, holidays, and so on may affect both the initial waiting period for your first deposit and subsequent deposits.\n\nWooCommerce Payments is built in partnership with Stripe.

This is for several reasons:\n\n*   When a charge is processed, we incur costs from the card networks (VISA and Mastercard) and from the payment partners we work with. Because these networks establish the rules and guidelines for refunded payments, very often they will keep the upfront cost of a refunded transaction. Therefore, these costs are not refunded to us when the charge is refunded.\n*   Our standard processing fees help provide WooCommerce Payments features and functionality, and allow us to continuously enhance your experience.\n*   WooCommerce Payments does not charge additional fees on top of the transaction fee to process a refund. (For example, we do not charge a $5 refund fee or similar.)\n\n## [Avoiding losses](#avoiding-losses)\n\nIf you wish to avoid losses due to the unrefunded fees, you can instead provide customers with a partial refund equal to the total order amount minus the fees you paid originally.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-26-at-19.14.23-UTC@2x.png)\n\nIf you do decide to do this, however, your store’s refund policy should clearly state this practice.

The most common by far is the following scenario:\n\n1.  You charge a customer for their order on your WooCommerce site.\n2.  Those funds get added to your WooCommerce Payments balance.\n3.  The money is deposited, reducing your account balance to zero.\n4.  You refund an order, or a dispute is filed. Now your balance is negative.\n\nThe higher your order volume is, the more rare this issue becomes, since new incoming orders will often provide your account balance with enough of a “buffer” to accommodate refunds and disputes. For low volume merchants, negative balances may happen more often, since there are fewer new sales to help offset incoming refunds or disputes.\n\n## [Recovering from a negative balance](#recovering)\n\nIf you use **a bank account** to receive deposits from your WooCommerce Payments accounts, your bank account [may be debited](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/withdrawals/) to cover the negative balance. If your bank account does not qualify to be debited, recovering from a negative balance will behave as described below in the debit card case.\n\nIf you use **a debit card** to receive deposits, your card will not be debited. Instead, the money from future sales on your site will pay down the negative balance. Once your balance becomes positive again, deposits to your card will resume as normal.\n\n**NOTE:** If you are using a debit card for deposits and your balance becomes negative, it will not be possible to issue refunds to customers until you’ve made enough sales to bring your balance back up to more than the refund amount. This is one reason we suggest adding a bank account instead of a debit card, if possible.","metadata":{"title":"Why is my account showing a negative balance?","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/account-showing-negative-balance/"}}],["239",{"pageContent":"# Why is there a Subscriptions item in my WooCommerce menu?\n\nStarting with WooCommerce 6.6, a _Subscriptions_ item in the menu offers eligible merchants a chance to use the [built-in subscriptions functionality](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/built-in-subscriptions/) of WooCommerce Payments.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Markup-2022-05-30-at-18.10.30.png)\n\n## [Eligibility criteria](#eligibility-criteria)\n\nIn order to see the _Subscriptions_ menu item suggestion, the site must:\n\n*   Allow tracking under **WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > WooCommerce.com**.\n*   Be based in the U.S.\n*   Be at least 6 months old.\n*   Have at least 1 order in the last 30 days.\n*   Not have any of the following plugins installed:\n    *   WooCommerce Subscriptions\n    *   WooCommerce Payments\n    *   Sumo Subscriptions\n    *   YITH Subscriptions\n    *   Subscripto\n    *   Subscriptions For WooCommerce\n\n## [Remove the Subscriptions menu item](#remove-menu-item)\n\nTo remove the _Subscriptions_ item from the WooCommerce menu, click the **No Thanks** button and the _Subscriptions_ item will disappear.\n\nTo programmatically remove the item (if, for example, you are a hosting provider or developer), create an option named `woocommerce-wcpay-subscriptions_dismissed` and set it to `yes`.

No transaction or other history will be moved to the current site.\n\nThe other site will continue using WooCommerce Payments without any changes.\n\n## [Dynamic Site URLs](#dynamic-site-urls)\n\nIn some cases, WooCommerce Payments can be put into Safe Mode when the WordPress site URL is defined in a “dynamic” way. This most often happens when sites have been created by Bitnami, or are hosted on Amazon Lightsail, or are running on multiple web servers behind a load balancer.\n\nTo determine if this applies to you, check your `wp-config.php` file for the presence of code similar to this:\n\ndefine( 'WP\\_SITEURL', 'http://' . $\\_SERVER\\['HTTP\\_HOST'\\] . '/' );\ndefine( 'WP\\_HOME', 'http://' . $\\_SERVER\\['HTTP\\_HOST'\\] .

In other words, even with this box unchecked, you will still be able to access the **Deposits**, **Transactions** and **Disputes** pages, as well as issue refunds and perform other such actions.\n\nIf you want to completely disable the WooCommerce Payments plugin, please see [this page](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/account-management/delete-my-woocommerce-payments-account/).\n\n### [Test mode](#test-mode)","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments Settings Guide","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/"}}],["272",{"pageContent":"### [Test mode](#test-mode)\n\nCheck this box to enable test mode.

However, by enabling the new checkout experience, you can also offer local payment methods to certain customers if you wish.

If you wish to opt out of these terms, please [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) and request that we unlink your WooCommerce Payments account from your site.\n\nKeep in mind that opting out in this way means that you will no longer be able to use WooCommerce Payments **at all**.

In order to help you choose between the two, we’ve highlighted some important differences here.\n\nIt’s also possible to use both gateways at the same time, although this does [cause a few issues](https://woocommerce.com/document/can-i-use-woocommerce-payments-and-the-stripe-plugin-at-the-same-time/) to be aware of.\n\n### [WordPress dashboard integration](#dashboard-integration)\n\nWooCommerce Payments is designed to integrate closely with your WordPress website. It does this by displaying all your transaction data, deposit records, [Capital loan](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-stripe-capital/) details, and other information right within your site’s dashboard. This means you don’t need to leave your site’s admin interface to perform common business tasks.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png)\n\nBank account deposits inside the WordPress dashboard\n\nThe regular Stripe plugin is not so closely integrated with the WordPress dashboard. As a result, some tasks will require you to log into Stripe’s dashboard to complete them. (For example, reconciling your payments or challenging disputes.)\n\n### [Built-in subscriptions features](#subscriptions)\n\nWith WooCommerce Payments, eligible merchants can charge for [subscription products](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/subscriptions/) with no additional plugins. This lets you sell products that take regularly recurring payments from your customers, such a monthly magazine or a quarterly subscription box.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png)\n\nAn example subscription product made with WooCommerce Payments","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments vs. Stripe Plugin Comparison","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-vs-stripe-plugin-comparison/"}}],["285",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png)\n\nAn example subscription product made with WooCommerce Payments\n\nThe regular Stripe plugin does not have this feature built-in. To be able to sell subscription products with the Stripe plugin, you would need [our premium Subscriptions extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).\n\n### [Accepting multiple currencies](#multiple-currencies)\n\nIf you sell your products to customers in multiple countries, you can use the [multi-currency features](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/multi-currency-setup/) in WooCommerce Payments to receive payments in various currencies. It can also give your customers a choice of currencies to pay in.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png)\n\nConfiguring which currencies to sell your products in\n\nThe regular Stripe plugin does not have this built-in. Instead, you would need to [install a second plugin](https://woocommerce.com/search/?q=currency&collections=product) to enable multi-currency support.\n\n### [In-person payments for Canada](#in-person-payments)\n\nWooCommerce Payments offers merchants in the U.S. and Canada the option to [accept in-person payments](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/getting-started-with-in-person-payments-with-woocommerce-payments/) using a card reader device.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_1A19F4CFC591-1.jpeg)\n\nTaking payment for an in-person order\n\nThe Stripe plugin only offers [in-person payments](https://woocommerce.com/document/stripe/accept-in-person-payments-with-stripe/) for U.S. merchants.\n\n### [Initial setup and API keys](#setup-and-api-keys)\n\nWooCommerce Payments creates a special kind of Stripe account for you during the signup process, called a Stripe Express account. This account is linked directly to your site, without you having to copy and paste any API keys. This makes the initial setup process less complex as compared to the Stripe plugin.","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments vs. Stripe Plugin Comparison","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-vs-stripe-plugin-comparison/"}}],["286",{"pageContent":"However, because WooCommerce Payments does not make the Stripe API keys available (even after setup is complete), it may not be suitable for certain merchants. For example, if you need to integrate with a third-party accounting service which requests the Stripe API keys, the Stripe plugin would be a better fit. This is because it connects to regular Stripe accounts, which do make their API keys available to you.\n\n### [Country availability](#country-availability)\n\nThe regular Stripe plugin supports businesses based in more countries than WooCommerce Payments at this time.

To help prevent abuse of this feature, both WooCommerce Payments and Stripe themselves have requirements that must be met before merchants can enable instant deposits.","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments vs. Stripe Plugin Comparison","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-vs-stripe-plugin-comparison/"}}],["287",{"pageContent":"WooCommerce Payments has slightly [different requirements](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/instant-deposits/#section-1) before merchants can enable Instant Deposits.

We also make a Stripe extension that integrates with regular Stripe accounts. As such, we have a document that explains [the differences between the two solutions](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-vs-stripe-plugin-comparison/), as well as a page on [how to use both](https://woocommerce.com/document/can-i-use-woocommerce-payments-and-the-stripe-plugin-at-the-same-time/), if you wish.\n\n## [Theme compatibility](#section-3)\n\nThemes that are [compatible with WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/choosing-the-right-theme/) will almost always work just fine with WooCommerce Payments. The [themes we sell in our Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes) are of course compatible.\n\nIf you need to test whether an issue is being caused by your theme, you can install and activate our [free Storefront theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/). Storefront works perfectly with WooCommerce Payments. Thus, if the issue does not occur while using Storefront, your original theme is likely to be the cause.\n\n## [Frequently asked questions](#section-4)","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Compatibility","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/compatibility/"}}],["297",{"pageContent":"## [Frequently asked questions](#section-4)\n\n*   [Do I need WooCommerce Payments for all other payment gateways?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/do-i-need-woocommerce-payments-for-all-other-payment-gateways/)\n*   [Does WooCommerce Payments support Pre-Orders?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/pre-orders/)\n*   [Is WooCommerce Payments compatible with High-Performance Order Storage?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/is-woocommerce-payments-compatible-with-high-performance-order-storage/)","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Compatibility","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/compatibility/"}}],["298",{"pageContent":"# WooCommerce Payments: Currencies\n\nWith WooCommerce Payments, you can take orders in [over 100 different currencies](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/available-currencies/), as well as present your products in the preferred currency of your customers.

As such, we’ve put together this page and the linked documents to help guide you through these complex topics.\n\nThe first thing to know is that a transaction is regarded as fraud if the cardholder did not authorize the charge. Fraudulent charges can be placed by third parties using stolen physical cards or, more often, stolen card numbers. When the real cardholder notices the charge on their statement, or in the online interface of their bank account, they will almost certainly contest the payment. This is known as a dispute.\n\nHandling fraud and customer disputes can be one of the most unpleasant parts of running a business. Our documentation pages on these topics will show you how to prevent fraud and disputes as much as possible, how to handle them when they do occur, and answer several common questions.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-17.png)\n\nResponding to a dispute in WooCommerce Payments\n\n## [Preventing disputes](#section-1)\n\nThe best way to avoid having to deal with disputes is to stop them from occurring in the first place. There are [a number of effective tactics](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/preventing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/) you can use to do this.\n\nThat said, it’s important to keep in mind that there is always _some_ risk that a customer will dispute their purchase, regardless of the payment gateway or platform you are using for your store. In other words, your goal should not be to have absolutely no disputes. Rather, your goal should be to minimize the odds of a dispute occurring.\n\n## [Managing disputes](#section-2)","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Fraud and Disputes","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/"}}],["308",{"pageContent":"## [Managing disputes](#section-2)\n\nNot responding to disputes can lead to fines and the possibility of being prohibited from doing business by the card networks.

Please see that list if you suspect that your store or products may not be allowed.\n\nSome common examples:\n\n*   [Can I sell CBD and other hemp-derived products with WooCommerce Payments?](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/cbd/)\n*   [Can I sell alcohol with WooCommerce Payments?](https://woocommerce.com/document/can-i-sell-alcohol-with-woocommerce-payments/)\n\n## [WordPress.com account](#wpcom-account)\n\nWooCommerce Payments [requires a WordPress.com account](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/connection/) to connect your site to the WooCommerce Payments server. You will be asked to connect to a WordPress.com account during the signup process, or you can [create a new one](https://wordpress.com/start/user) if you don’t have one already.\n\nThe WordPress.com account is used to ensure that requests (for payments, refunds, etc.) from your site are securely and correctly attributed to your store.\n\n### [Jetpack](#jetpack)","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Our Policies","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/"}}],["316",{"pageContent":"The WordPress.com account is used to ensure that requests (for payments, refunds, etc.) from your site are securely and correctly attributed to your store.\n\n### [Jetpack](#jetpack)\n\nThe [Jetpack plugin](https://jetpack.com/) is not required to use WooCommerce Payments. WooCommerce Payments does connect your site with WordPress.com as described above, but the Jetpack plugin itself is not necessary to make this connection.\n\nThat said, Jetpack can be installed alongside WooCommerce Payments to add additional security, performance, and marketing tools to your site. It will use the same WordPress.com connection as WooCommerce Payments, so there’s no need to connect it separately.\n\n## [“Know your customer”](#know-your-customer)\n\nBecause the payments sector is heavily regulated, we must gather certain information from you before you’ll be able to use WooCommerce Payments. For example, during the signup process you may be asked for the following:\n\n**Personal information**\n\n*   Your name\n*   Date of birth\n*   Home address\n*   Bank account info\n*   etc.\n\n**Business information**\n\n*   Type of business\n*   Business address\n*   Phone number\n*   Business tax ID\n*   etc.\n\nIn the payments industry, this process is called “know your customer” or just “KYC.” Please consult our [Know Your Customer FAQ](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/woocommerce-payments-know-your-customer/) for answers to further questions.\n\n## [Restricted accounts](#restricted-accounts)\n\nOn rare occasions, card payments and deposits may be restricted on your account. This can happen for a variety of reasons:\n\n*   Your account is missing important information and the deadline to provide it has passed.\n*   Dispute activity has increased substantially, beyond reasonable thresholds.\n*   Our payments partner, Stripe, has found other issues with your account.","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Our Policies","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/"}}],["317",{"pageContent":"If your account is restricted, you should receive an email with information about the issue, either from the WooCommerce team or Stripe. Please respond to this email to address the issue.\n\nIn rare cases, we may also request verification of your identity through [Validation.com](https://validation.com/). If this applies to you, we will send a separate email with instructions on how to verify.\n\nIf your account is restricted, but you did not receive an email, please [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/).\n\n## [Reserves](#reserves)\n\nBecause WooCommerce Payments is [built in partnership with Stripe](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/built-in-partnership-with-stripe/), they make the final determination on whether or not to temporarily withhold some (or all) of your deposits based on perceived risk factors. This is called a “reserve.”\n\nPlease see [our Reserves guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/reserves/) for more information.\n\n## [Return policies](#return-policies)\n\nWooCommerce Payments [offers in-person payments](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/getting-started-with-in-person-payments-with-woocommerce-payments/) via a physical card reader. Should you need to return a card reader to us, please consult our [card reader return policy](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments-card-reader-return-policy/).\n\n## [Data security](#data-security)\n\nWooCommerce Payments is [PCI compliant](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/pci-compliance/), but merchants should still be aware of the core PCI-DSS requirements. For more general information, please see our [PCI-DSS Compliance and WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/pci-dss-compliance-and-woocommerce/) documentation.","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Our Policies","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/"}}],["318",{"pageContent":"# WooCommerce Payments: Payment Methods\n\nWooCommerce Payments can take payments from customers using credit cards, debit cards, as well as additional forms of payment. Some of these payment methods may only available in certain countries or regions, while others are only available on certain types of devices.\n\n## [Credit and debit cards](#cards)\n\nWooCommerce Payments can charge most common card brands, including:\n\n*   American Express\n*   China UnionPay (CUP)\n*   Discover & Diners\n*   Japan Credit Bureau (JCB)\n*   Mastercard\n*   VISA\n\nMastercard and VISA cards can be accepted by merchants in every country. Other brands have some restrictions, but they are few and rarely encountered in practice.\n\n## [Local payment methods](#local-payment-methods)\n\nLocal payment methods, once enabled, will only be shown to customers in a certain region or country, because they will only work for those customers. This includes payment methods such as Sofort, iDeal, Bancontact, etc.\n\nOur [full list of local payment methods](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/additional-payment-methods/) shows which ones are available and where.\n\n## [Express checkout methods](#express-checkout-methods)\n\nExpress checkout methods are so named because they allow customers to check out faster than if the customer had not used one of these methods.

This is called a “reserve.”\n\nReserves are meant to protect the payments processor (Stripe, in this case) against losses arising from future refunds and disputes. Funds that are withheld as part of a reserve will, in time, be deposited into your bank account as normal once the reserve has ended, minus any refunds or disputes of course.\n\n**NOTE:** Because Stripe, not WooCommerce, implements and manages these account reserves, they will be the ones to email you about it. We (meaning WooCommerce) have little to no insight about the details of your reserve or the specifics of why it was applied to your account.\n\n## [Why is there a reserve on my account?](#why-a-reserve-on-my-account)\n\nA reserve may be implemented if Stripe thinks that your business represents a higher than acceptable level of risk. This can be due to a number of reasons, such as:\n\n*   Your industry’s delivery window is longer than average\n*   Your business has an increased risk of non-fulfillment\n*   Your account’s dispute activity is higher than normal\n*   There’s unexplainable sharp increase in order volume\n\n## [Will I lose money? Is this a fine?](#lose-money-fine)\n\nNo. A reserve is not a fine, and no money is deducted from your account balance. A reserve only means that Stripe is temporarily withholding a portion of the money from being deposited.\n\nIn almost all cases, the entire amount being held in reserve will eventually be deposited into your bank account. See the _[When will the reserve end?](#when-will-reserve-end)_ section for more details.\n\n## [How will I be notified of a reserve?](#how-will-i-be-notified)\n\nStripe will email the account address directly. That email will include the following information:","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Reserves","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/reserves/"}}],["320",{"pageContent":"## [How will I be notified of a reserve?](#how-will-i-be-notified)\n\nStripe will email the account address directly. That email will include the following information:\n\n*   What portion of your funds are subject to the reserve\n*   The reason(s) why Stripe implemented the reserve\n*   The amount of time the reserve will last\n*   A link where you can go to appeal the reserve\n\n## [Can I still take payments?](#can-i-take-payments)\n\nYes. Reserves do not prevent you from charging customers, so your ability to continue taking new orders will not be affected.\n\n## [Can I appeal a reserve with Stripe?](#can-i-appeal)\n\nYes. The email you receive about the reserve will include a link to appeal.\n\nIf you do decide to appeal, it’s best to provide as much detail as possible when responding to Stripe’s questions. Include any relevant documentation you have. The more information Stripe has about your business, the faster the appeal process will go.\n\n## [When will the reserve end?](#when-will-reserve-end)\n\nStripe’s initial email to you will contain the length of the reserve. However, that is not a guarantee that the reserve will end at that time.\n\nBefore the reserve is set to end, Stripe will re-review your account and determine whether to remove the reserve or extend it. This decision depends on the overall financial health of your business, the number of refunds and disputes on your account, and other factors.\n\nAlthough rare, there are some cases in which a reserve may be extended indefinitely.\n\n## [How can I avoid a reserve?](#how-to-avoid-reserves)\n\nThere are a number of common-sense methods you can use to avoid being subject to a reserve:","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Reserves","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/reserves/"}}],["321",{"pageContent":"## [How can I avoid a reserve?](#how-to-avoid-reserves)\n\nThere are a number of common-sense methods you can use to avoid being subject to a reserve:\n\n*   [Keep customer disputes to a minimum](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/preventing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/) if possible\n*   [Respond to any disputes](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/managing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/) quickly after they are filed\n*   [Protect your business against fraudulent purchases](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/card-testing/)\n*   Make [your store policies](https://woocommerce.com/posts/faq-page-design/) easy for customers to find\n*   Keep detailed [business and shipping records](https://woocommerce.com/posts/shipping-methods-fulfillment-options/)\n*   Provide an easy way for customers to [contact you](https://woocommerce.com/posts/covid-19-customer-communication/)\n*   Communicate any fulfillment delays to customers","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Reserves","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/reserves/"}}],["322",{"pageContent":"# WooCommerce Payments: Startup Guide\n\nThanks for choosing WooCommerce Payments! \n\nWe provide an integrated payments solution to get you up and running quickly, without setup costs or monthly fees.

This way, you can try out the various features of WooCommerce Payments on your site without charging a live payment method.\n\nPlease see [our guide to using test mode](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/) for instructions on how to enable and use test mode.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-28-at-14.59.15-UTC@2x.png)\n\nThe “Test mode active” warning shows when WooCommerce Payments is in test mode.\n\n## [Dev mode](#dev-mode)\n\nIf you want to try out WooCommerce Payments on a site that does not need to process real payments, you can use [Dev Mode](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/dev-mode/). This can come in handy on staging sites and the like.","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Testing & Troubleshooting","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/testing-and-troubleshooting/"}}],["334",{"pageContent":"With Dev Mode, it’s possible to create a test account that requires no personal information. This account can then be used to process test transactions. It will only operate in Test Mode and cannot be used to process live transactions.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-28-at-15.11.39-UTC@2x.png)\n\nThe “Test mode” setting indicating that dev mode is active.\n\nIf you are a developer or agency setting up a site for a client, we have [a few guidelines](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/developer-or-agency-setup/) that will be helpful as you do that.\n\n## [Safe mode](#safe-mode)\n\n[Safe mode](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/safe-mode/) helps prevent issues in cases where duplicated sites are connected to the same WooCommerce Payments account, which may occur when you clone your site to or from a staging site to a live one. Please see guide linked above for tips on what can cause Safe Mode to be triggered, as well as how to address the issue.\n\nSafe mode should almost never be triggered deliberately. Instead, we suggest using Dev Mode (explained above) on staging sites.\n\n## [Clearing the account cache](#clearing-account-cache)\n\nTo improve performance, WooCommerce Payments caches some information in the WordPress database. On occasion, you may be asked by our support team to clear this cache. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to **WooCommerce > Status > Tools** page.\n2.  Scroll down to the **Clear WooCommerce Payments account cache** tool.\n3.  Click **Clear**.\n\n![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-04-at-12.33.47-UTC@2x.png)\n\nClearing the account cache under WooCommerce > Status > Tools\n\nThis tool will clear the cached account details so that they are immediately refreshed from the WooCommerce Payments server.","metadata":{"title":"WooCommerce Payments: Testing & Troubleshooting","url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/testing-and-troubleshooting/"}}]]
