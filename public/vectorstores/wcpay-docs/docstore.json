When will I receive deposits for my WooCommerce Payments account balance?          When determining how quickly money you’ve made from purchases on your site will be deposited into to your bank account, there are two time periods to consider.    First, there’s how long it takes the funds to be made available for the next deposit after it’s been received by WooCommerce Payments. This is called the “pending period.” Second, there’s how often any available deposits are actually sent to your bank account. This is called the “deposit schedule.”    The pending period is a standard rolling delay that is determined by the country your business operates in. See the chart below for details on that. The deposit schedule can be changed to suit the needs of your business.     As an example: a merchant based in Canada has a pending period of 7 business days. If a customer purchases from their store on Monday, those fund are added to the merchant’s account balance right away, but not available for deposit until the following Tuesday, 7 business days","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/deposit-schedule/"}}],["5",{"pageContent":"has a pending period of 7 business days.

As mentioned above, this would be 7 business days from the initial purchase. If the merchant is on a weekly deposit schedule on Thursdays, for example, the funds would be sent on the coming Thursday, a total of 9 business days after the initial purchase.Another example: a business in New Zealand has a pending period of 4 business days. If that business has a daily deposit schedule, payments made to this account on a Wednesday will be paid out on the following Tuesday. If they have a weekly deposit schedule set for Fridays, the payment would be paid out on the following Friday.

You can check the minimum deposit amounts here.    New account waiting period ↑ Back to top    The first deposit for all new accounts is initiated after a 7 day waiting period. This waiting period mitigates some risk in providing credit services. The waiting period starts after the first successful charge is processed on your account, not when the account is created.    After the 7 day waiting period for an account is over, the regular pending period will apply, per the chart below. Deposits will begin to be delivered according to the deposit schedule determined for that account.     Note that delays in bank processing times due to weekends, holidays, and so on may affect both the initial waiting period for your first deposit and subsequent deposits.     WooCommerce Payments is built in partnership with Stripe. When you receive your first deposit you may receive a text message from Stripe informing you of its arrival.

What is the difference between a scheduled deposit and instant deposit?          With WooCommerce Payments, after a customer makes a purchase through your store, the funds from that transaction are placed into a pending balance on your account.    Normally, the funds in your account are subject to a standard pending period, after which they are made available for the next upcoming deposit. You can change the deposit schedule if you wish, between daily, weekly, and monthly. Scheduled deposits such as these can take a day or more to arrive in your bank account. There are no extra fees for these regular deposits.    With Instant Deposits, you can request some or all of your available balance to be deposited immediately, up to a daily maximum. These deposits can only be made to debit cards, and are subject to an additional fee, but the funds will arrive within minutes.

To avoid these fees, you may be able to have funds in different currencies deposited into separate bank accounts.    When using multiple bank accounts, one must be selected as the default. If you receive a payment in a currency that does not match the currency of one of your bank accounts, it will be converted into your default deposit currency and deposit into that default account.

This balance is regularly transferred to your bank account or debit card. These transfers are referred to as “deposits.”    You may be familiar with the term “payouts” from other payment gateways.

As such, we’ve put together this page and the linked documents to help guide you through these complex topics.    The first thing to know is that a transaction is regarded as fraud if the cardholder did not authorize the charge. Fraudulent charges can be placed by third parties using stolen physical cards or, more often, stolen card numbers. When the real cardholder notices the charge on their statement, or in the online interface of their bank account, they will almost certainly contest the payment. This is known as a dispute.    Handling fraud and customer disputes can be one of the most unpleasant parts of running a business. Our documentation pages on these topics will show you how to prevent fraud and disputes as much as possible, how to handle them when they do occur, and answer several common questions.

Responding to a dispute in WooCommerce Payments    Preventing disputes ↑ Back to top    The best way to avoid having to deal with disputes is to stop them from occurring in the first place. There are a number of effective tactics you can use to do this.    That said, it’s important to keep in mind that there is always some risk that a customer will dispute their purchase, regardless of the payment gateway or platform you are using for your store. In other words, your goal should not be to have absolutely no disputes. Rather, your goal should be to minimize the odds of a dispute occurring.    Managing disputes ↑ Back to top    Not responding to disputes can lead to fines and the possibility of being prohibited from doing business by the card networks. Our guide to managing disputes provides you with some helpful advice on how to respond.

In other words, there are no setup fees, monthly fees, or other hidden charges. Instead, our fees are deducted directly from each payment made via WooCommerce Payments.    The exact fees we charge differ based on various factors, such as:     The country your business is located in.    The country your customer is located in.    The currency with which the customer paid.    The payment method chosen by the customer.     Please see our full list of fees for a detailed breakdown.

Why is my account showing a negative balance?          Your WooCommerce Payments balance can become negative in a few ways. The most common by far is the following scenario:     You charge a customer for their order on your WooCommerce site.    Those funds get added to your WooCommerce Payments balance.    The money is deposited, reducing your account balance to zero.    You refund an order, or a dispute is filed. Now your balance is negative.     The higher your order volume is, the more rare this issue becomes, since new incoming orders will often provide your account balance with enough of a “buffer” to accommodate refunds and disputes. For low volume merchants, negative balances may happen more often, since there are fewer new sales to help offset incoming refunds or disputes.

Once your balance becomes positive again, deposits to your card will resume as normal.    NOTE: If you are using a debit card for deposits and your balance becomes negative, it will not be possible to issue refunds to customers until you’ve made enough sales to bring your balance back up to more than the refund amount.

What is the difference between a scheduled deposit and instant deposit?          With WooCommerce Payments, after a customer makes a purchase through your store, the funds from that transaction are placed into a pending balance on your account.    Normally, the funds in your account are subject to a standard pending period, after which they are made available for the next upcoming deposit. You can change the deposit schedule if you wish, between daily, weekly, and monthly. Scheduled deposits such as these can take a day or more to arrive in your bank account. There are no extra fees for these regular deposits.    With Instant Deposits, you can request some or all of your available balance to be deposited immediately, up to a daily maximum. These deposits can only be made to debit cards, and are subject to an additional fee, but the funds will arrive within minutes.
