In general, the subscriptions functionality built into WooCommerce Payments is best suited to stores testing out a new recurring revenue model.

The exact fees we charge differ based on various factors, such as the country your business is located in, the country your customer is located in, the currency with which the customer paid, the payment method chosen by the customer, and so on.

It’s also helpful to keep in mind that there is always some risk that a customer will dispute their purchase, regardless of the payment gateway or platform you are using for your store","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/preventing-disputes-with-woocommerce-payments/","title":"Preventing Disputes with WooCommerce Payments"}}],["123",{"pageContent":"It’s also helpful to keep in mind that there is always some risk that a customer will dispute their purchase, regardless of the payment gateway or platform you are using for your store.

Card testing is a type of fraud where the perpetrator first obtains a large amount of stolen credit card information, and then attempts to determine which of those cards are valid. They do this by making many individual purchases, each with a different card. Other terms for this activity include “carding” or “card checking.”     Though they are usually rare, the potential for a card testing attack is an unavoidable part of running an online business","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fraud-and-disputes/card-testing/","title":"How do I respond to card testing attacks?"}}],["148",{"pageContent":"Other terms for this activity include “carding” or “card checking.”     Though they are usually rare, the potential for a card testing attack is an unavoidable part of running an online business.

Another common sign of card testing is a large increase in the number of orders being assigned the Failed status. These orders may contain multiple notes about cards being declined.

Why is my account showing a negative balance?          Your WooCommerce Payments balance can become negative in a few ways. The most common by far is the following scenario:     You charge a customer for their order on your WooCommerce site.    Those funds get added to your WooCommerce Payments balance.    The money is deposited, reducing your account balance to zero.    You refund an order, or a dispute is filed. Now your balance is negative.     The higher your order volume is, the more rare this issue becomes, since new incoming orders will often provide your account balance with enough of a “buffer” to accommodate refunds and disputes","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/account-showing-negative-balance/","title":"Why is my account showing a negative balance?"}}],["259",{"pageContent":"The higher your order volume is, the more rare this issue becomes, since new incoming orders will often provide your account balance with enough of a “buffer” to accommodate refunds and disputes.

Prior to June 7th 2021, the currency conversion fee was built into the foreign exchange rate used for the transaction. Under this system, to determine the exchange rate for a transaction, WooCommerce Payments would use the mid-market foreign rate and add an additional 1-2% to that rate. It then applied that to the charge amount to determine the equivalent amount in the deposit currency.    Because the fee was built into the exchange rate, the timeline view on the transaction details screen did not include the currency conversion fee in the fees breakdown. Instead, it was factored into the exchange rate displayed on this screen. This same behavior exists for all transactions made prior to June 7th 2021.

NOTE: One thing you should not do is refund the customer for their disputed order using some other method besides WooCommerce Payments. This is because, if you lose the dispute later on, the amount of the order will automatically be refunded to them from your WooCommerce Payments account.

Duplicate: customer claims multiple charges were placed on their card for the same product or service.

General or Unrecognized: the card holder notifies their card issuer that they do not recognize the charge on their card statement.    Product not received: the good or service for which the charge was processed has not been received by the customer. For example, a shipment from your business has not been received by your customer.

The first thing to know is that a transaction is regarded as fraud if the cardholder did not authorize the charge. Fraudulent charges can be placed by third parties using stolen physical cards or, more often, stolen card numbers. When the real cardholder notices the charge on their statement, or in the online interface of their bank account, they will almost certainly contest the payment.

In fact, they happen so fast that many people don’t realize that there are actually two events taking place: an authorization and a capture.    By default, WooCommerce Payments will perform the authorization and capture at the same time","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/authorize-and-capture/","title":"Authorize and capture"}}],["536",{"pageContent":"By default, WooCommerce Payments will perform the authorization and capture at the same time.

This document explains a bit more about how authorizations and captures work, and provides some example uses cases for which enabling the option might be a good idea.    What is an authorization vs. a capture? ↑ Back to top    An authorization is the first part of the charge process, in which the payment processor connects to the bank that issued the customer’s card and determines if the customer has enough money to cover the transaction cost. During this step, the funds are “held” or reserved for payment, but not actually sent to the merchant yet","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/authorize-and-capture/","title":"Authorize and capture"}}],["537",{"pageContent":"During this step, the funds are “held” or reserved for payment, but not actually sent to the merchant yet.    A capture (also known as “settlement”) occurs when the merchant instructs the payment processor to transfer some or all of the held funds from the customer’s account to their own. The customer’s bank then sends the requested amount of money. The merchant also has the option of cancelling the authorization.    Notably, authorizations are temporary in nature. They must be captured within seven days or the authorization will automatically expire. If that happens, the reserved funds are freed back up in the customer’s account.    When is manual capture helpful? ↑ Back to top    Manually capturing authorizations is usually used in scenarios where some payment is needed up-front, but the exact final amount is not known initially","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/authorize-and-capture/","title":"Authorize and capture"}}],["538",{"pageContent":"Here’s a list of some common examples where this workflow is used:     Gas/petrol stations where you “pay at the pump” issue an authorization before you beginning filling up your vehicle. When you’re done, and the exact amount of the charge is known to their system, they will capture that amount.     Hotels have an even longer time between when the charge is authorized (usually at check-in) and when the charge is captured (usually at check-out).    Equipment rental businesses may request a card so that they can issue an authorization prior to allowing their customers to take the equipment home.    Craftsmen who take custom orders (for a piece of furniture, say) might decide to authorize a customer’s card ahead of time and capture a different amount later on, depending on the exact work involved in the customer’s request.     Manual capture disadvantages ↑ Back to top    As you can see above, there are a few limited situations where authorizing first and capturing later are needed","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/settings-guide/authorize-and-capture/","title":"Authorize and capture"}}],["539",{"pageContent":"Manual capture disadvantages ↑ Back to top    As you can see above, there are a few limited situations where authorizing first and capturing later are needed. However, for the vast majority of merchants using WooCommerce Payments, authorizing and capturing separately has several disadvantages:     Authorizations are temporary: they expire after seven days. If you don’t capture them in time, the customer will need to start the purchase process all over again. You might not even notice that you did not capture the charge until after you have shipped the customer their goods!    You cannot capture more than the amount originally authorized.
