WooCommerce Payments: Deposits # WooCommerce Payments: Deposits One of the largest concerns of any for-profit business is simple: getting paid. The documents in this section explain how often your account balance is paid out to your bank account, as well as answer any questions you might have about deposits. **NOTE:** You may have heard other payment gateways or processors refer to these as “payouts.” Although the terms are differents, they [refer to the same thing](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/deposits-and-payouts/)","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/"}}],["11",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-28-at-18.10.44-UTC@2x.png) The WooCommerce Payments Deposits page, showing upcoming deposits ## [Deposit timing](#deposit-timing) The main page to review on deposits is our [deposit schedule document](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/deposit-schedule/). It explains how often your balance will be paid out depending on your business location, as well as other important details to keep in mind when it comes to getting your money. We also have a document on why your [deposits might be suspended](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/deposits-suspended/) and what to do about it. ## [Managing deposits](#section-2) In some cases, it is possible to [change your deposit schedule](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/how-do-i-change-my-deposit-schedule-with-woocommerce-payments/) to better suit the needs of your business","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/"}}],["12",{"pageContent":"You can also [change the bank account](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/change-deposit-account/) that deposits are routed to. If your store accepts multiple currencies, you may also want to [add more than one bank account](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/currencies/multiple-deposit-currencies/) in order to avoid currency conversion fees. ## [Instant deposits](#instant-deposits) Instant Deposits (available to some merchants) are a way of getting even faster access to your money. Our [Instant Deposits guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/instant-deposits/) provides an overview of the feature, and [this FAQ page](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/scheduled-deposit-vs-instant-deposit/) explains the differences between Instant Deposits and regular deposits.","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/"}}],["13",{"pageContent":"1.

When will I receive deposits for my WooCommerce Payments account balance? # When will I receive deposits for my WooCommerce Payments account balance? When determining how quickly money you’ve made from purchases on your site will be deposited into to your bank account, there are two time periods to consider. First, there’s how long it takes the funds to be made available for the next deposit after it’s been received by WooCommerce Payments. This is called the “pending period.” Second, there’s how often any available deposits are actually sent to your bank account. This is called the “deposit schedule.” The pending period is a standard rolling delay that is determined by the country your business operates in","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/deposit-schedule/"}}],["14",{"pageContent":"This is called the “deposit schedule.” The pending period is a standard rolling delay that is determined by the country your business operates in. See the chart below for details on that. The deposit schedule [can be changed](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/how-do-i-change-my-deposit-schedule-with-woocommerce-payments/#section-2) to suit the needs of your business. As an example: a merchant based in Canada has a pending period of 7 business days. If a customer purchases from their store on Monday, those fund are added to the merchant’s account balance right away, but not available for deposit until the following Tuesday, 7 business days later. After that, when the funds are sent to their bank depends on the merchant’s deposit schedule. If the merchant has a daily deposit schedule, the deposit including those funds will be sent on the following Tuesday. As mentioned above, this would be 7 business days from the initial purchase","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/deposit-schedule/"}}],["15",{"pageContent":"If the merchant has a daily deposit schedule, the deposit including those funds will be sent on the following Tuesday. As mentioned above, this would be 7 business days from the initial purchase. If the merchant is on a weekly deposit schedule on Thursdays, for example, the funds would be sent on the coming Thursday, a total of 9 business days after the initial purchase. Another example: a business in New Zealand has a pending period of 4 business days. If that business has a daily deposit schedule, payments made to this account on a Wednesday will be paid out on the following Tuesday. If they have a weekly deposit schedule set for Fridays, the payment would be paid out on the following Friday. Most banks will reflect the deposit in your account as soon as they receive the transfer from WooCommerce Payments. Some may take a few extra days to make the balance available to you. You can check the minimum deposit amounts [here](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/deposit-schedule/#section-4)","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/deposits/deposit-schedule/"}}],["16",{"pageContent":"Some may take a few extra days to make the balance available to you. You can check the minimum deposit amounts [here](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/deposit-schedule/#section-4). ## [New account waiting period](#section-1) **The first deposit for all new accounts is initiated after a 7 day waiting period.** This waiting period mitigates some risk in providing credit services. The waiting period starts after the first successful charge is processed on your account, not when the account is created. After the 7 day waiting period for an account is over, the regular pending period will apply, per the chart below. Deposits will begin to be delivered according to the deposit schedule determined for that account. Note that delays in bank processing times due to weekends, holidays, and so on may affect both the initial waiting period for your first deposit and subsequent deposits.

We also have a handy guide to common errors that, although rare, do occur from time to time. ## [Troubleshooting](#section-1) Although WooCommerce Payments is designed to be dependable and broadly compatible with other plugins, problems can occur in any complex piece of software. Our [self-service guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-self-service-guide/) explains how to resolve many common issues. If need be, you can [reach out to our support staff](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) for assistance","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/testing-and-troubleshooting/"}}],["46",{"pageContent":"If need be, you can [reach out to our support staff](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) for assistance. ## [Test mode](#test-mode) By default, WooCommerce Payments will place real charges on real payment methods, such as credit and debit cards. WooCommerce Payments also provides an easy-to-enable test mode, which simulates the real payments process as closely as possible. This way, you can try out the various features of WooCommerce Payments on your site without charging a live payment method.

This account can then be used to process test transactions. It will only operate in Test Mode and cannot be used to process live transactions. ![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-28-at-15.11.39-UTC@2x.png) The “Test mode” setting indicating that dev mode is active","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/testing-and-troubleshooting/"}}],["48",{"pageContent":"![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screenshot-taken-on-2022-10-28-at-15.11.39-UTC@2x.png) The “Test mode” setting indicating that dev mode is active.

These are explained below. ### [Subscriptions created before version 5.2.0](#section-11) Customers who initiate subscriptions while the merchant’s site is running WooCommerce Payments **5.1.2 or prior** will have all of their automatic renewals fail. Specifically, the initial purchase will work, but all renewals after that will fail with `transaction_not_allowed`","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/built-in-subscriptions/subscriptions-basics/"}}],["67",{"pageContent":"Specifically, the initial purchase will work, but all renewals after that will fail with `transaction_not_allowed`.

The fee is not charged up-front.  ### **How does repayment work?**  Repayment is collected automatically through a percentage of your WooCommerce sales, which means you pay down more when business is busy and less if things slow down","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/stripe-capital/faq/"}}],["94",{"pageContent":"As long as you meet your minimum payment requirement every 60 days, what you pay each day adjusts to your sales. ### [What is a minimum payment?](#what-is-a-minimum-payment) A minimum payment is the minimum amount that you’re expected to repay every 60 days such that the maximum duration of the loan does not exceed 18 months. If the total amount that you repay through payments deducted from your sales in a 60-day period falls below the minimum payment requirement, you will be required to pay the remaining amount at the end of the period. You can view your minimum payment amount in the Dashboard or in your loan agreement.   ### [How do I make my minimum payment?](#how-do-i-make-my-minimum-payment) If the portion deducted from your sales covers the minimum payment requirement for the 60-day period, no additional action will be taken","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/stripe-capital/faq/"}}],["95",{"pageContent":"If you have not met the minimum payment amount by the end of the 60-day period, Stripe will automatically debit your bank account for the remaining amount needed to meet your minimum payment. This will occur automatically, so there is no need to make a manual payment. ### [After I accept an offer, how quickly will I get my funds?](#after-i-accept-an-offer-how-quickly-will-i-get-my-funds) If your application is approved, you’ll see the funds in your bank account typically in 1-2 business days. ### [What happens when my offer expires?](#what-happens-when-my-offer-expires) Each offer is available for 30 days. After that point, your business will automatically be re-evaluated to see if you’re eligible for an additional offer.   ### [Can I repay my loan early?](#can-i-repay-my-loan-early) Yes, you can make additional payments or pay the total amount owed in full at any point by clicking the ‘Make Payment’ button in your loan overview page. There are no additional fees for early repayment","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/stripe-capital/faq/"}}],["96",{"pageContent":"There are no additional fees for early repayment. ### **Will repaying early qualify me for a new offer?**  Once you repay the total amount owed, you’ll automatically be evaluated for a new offer. Repaying early does not automatically qualify you for a new offer. ### [How should I report these funds on my taxes?](#how-should-i-report-these-funds-on-my-taxes) Tax reporting is often dependent on your specific situation, so we encourage you to talk with a tax advisor to ensure appropriate accounting.

See the section below for some background and potential fixes. ### [Domain registration](#domain-registration) In order for your store to accept Apple Pay transactions, WooCommerce Payments automatically registers your domain as a verified Apple Pay merchant. Our plugin hosts the `apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` file under your domain root, for example: `https://www.example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` Please check if this file is available from your own domain.

Yes, WooCommerce Payments itself is PCI compliant, but merchants still need to be aware of the core PCI-DSS core requirements. For more general information, please see our [PCI-DSS Compliance and WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/pci-dss-compliance-and-woocommerce/) documentation. ## [What makes WooCommerce Payments PCI Compliant?](#what-makes-woocommerce-payments-pci-compliant) WooCommerce Payments uses a hosted payment field for handling all payment card data, so the cardholder enters all sensitive payment information in a payment field that originates directly from our partner’s PCI-DSS validated servers","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/our-policies/pci-compliance/"}}],["162",{"pageContent":"This means the information is not directly stored on your site. ## [What data is stored on my site?](#what-data-is-stored-on-my-site) WooCommerce stores the data entered in the other checkout fields, such as name, address, country, and so on.

As such, we’ve put together this page and the linked documents to help guide you through these complex topics. The first thing to know is that a transaction is regarded as fraud if the cardholder did not authorize the charge. Fraudulent charges can be placed by third parties using stolen physical cards or, more often, stolen card numbers. When the real cardholder notices the charge on their statement, or in the online interface of their bank account, they will almost certainly contest the payment. This is known as a dispute.

The exact fees we charge differ based on various factors, such as the country your business is located in, the country your customer is located in, the currency with which the customer paid, the payment method chosen by the customer, and so on.

Why is my account showing a negative balance? # Why is my account showing a negative balance? Your WooCommerce Payments balance can become negative in a few ways. The most common by far is the following scenario: 1. You charge a customer for their order on your WooCommerce site. 2. Those funds get added to your WooCommerce Payments balance. 3. The money is deposited, reducing your account balance to zero. 4. You refund an order, or a dispute is filed. Now your balance is negative. The higher your order volume is, the more rare this issue becomes, since new incoming orders will often provide your account balance with enough of a “buffer” to accommodate refunds and disputes","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/account-showing-negative-balance/"}}],["219",{"pageContent":"The higher your order volume is, the more rare this issue becomes, since new incoming orders will often provide your account balance with enough of a “buffer” to accommodate refunds and disputes. For low volume merchants, negative balances may happen more often, since there are fewer new sales to help offset incoming refunds or disputes. ## [Recovering from a negative balance](#recovering) If you use **a bank account** to receive deposits from your WooCommerce Payments accounts, your bank account [may be debited](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/withdrawals/) to cover the negative balance. If your bank account does not qualify to be debited, recovering from a negative balance will behave as described below in the debit card case. If you use **a debit card** to receive deposits, your card will not be debited. Instead, the money from future sales on your site will pay down the negative balance. Once your balance becomes positive again, deposits to your card will resume as normal","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/account-showing-negative-balance/"}}],["220",{"pageContent":"Instead, the money from future sales on your site will pay down the negative balance. Once your balance becomes positive again, deposits to your card will resume as normal. **NOTE:** If you are using a debit card for deposits and your balance becomes negative, it will not be possible to issue refunds to customers until you’ve made enough sales to bring your balance back up to more than the refund amount. This is one reason we suggest adding a bank account instead of a debit card, if possible.","metadata":{"url":"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-payments/fees-and-debits/account-showing-negative-balance/"}}],["221",{"pageContent":"1.
